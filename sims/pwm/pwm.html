        <h2>ChatGPT Prompt</h2>
        <p>
Generate a p5.js sketch file of a simulation of a static pulse width
modulation (PWM) waveform on a 600x300 canvas.<br/><br/>

Add a range control slider to adjust the Duty Cycle of the waveform.
Make the default be 50%.
The min should be 0% and the max should be 100%.
Place the range control slider at the bottom of the canvas.
Make sure the range control slider has a width of 400px using the style attribute.<br/>

At the end of the draw() function add a text() function that displays <br/>
the label and value of the duty cycle.<br/><br/>
</p>

<h2>ChatGPT Explanation:</h2>

<p>
This sketch creates a simple sinewave that toggles between two 
heights to create a PWM waveform. 
The height of the waveform is determined by the duty cycle, with the waveform 
being "high" during the "on" period and "low" during the "off" period.
The duty cycle is 
controlled by a slider, and the current duty cycle is displayed at the
bottom of the sketch. 
The nf() function is used to format the duty cycle as a percentage with
two decimal places.
<br/><br/>
By multiplying TWO_PI by cycles in the map function, we can adjust the
frequency of the waveform. 
By increasing the number of cycles to 10, 
the waveform now completes 10 full cycles across the width of the canvas.
