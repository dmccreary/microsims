### Added UDL (Universal Design for Learning) to Accessibility Section
- **File:** `sections/05-design-framework.tex`
- **Location:** Section 5.1.2 "Accessibility by Design" (line 26)
- **Description:** Added paragraph explaining how MicroSims align with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles by providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression through multimodal interfaces and adaptable user controls.
- **Original TODO:** "In alignment with Universal Design for Learning (UDL), MicroSims provide multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression through multimodal interfaces and adaptable user controls."

### Added Semantic Waves Concept to Cognitive Load Management
- **File:** `sections/05-design-framework.tex`
- **Location:** Section 5.2.2 "Cognitive Load Management" (line 52)
- **Description:** Added paragraph explaining how MicroSims intentionally guide learners through semantic waves—unpacking abstract concepts into tangible, interactive experiences, and then repacking them into generalized understanding. This signals that MicroSims develop conceptual transfer by moving learners between concrete manipulation and abstract reasoning.
- **Original TODO:** "MicroSims intentionally guide learners through a semantic wave — unpacking abstract concepts into tangible, interactive experiences, and then repacking them into generalized understanding."

### Added PRIMM Methodology Integration Section
- **File:** `sections/05-design-framework.tex`
- **Location:** New subsubsection 5.2.4 "PRIMM Methodology Integration" (line 60)
- **Description:** Added complete new subsection explaining how the MicroSims framework aligns with the PRIMM methodology (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, and Make). This structured progression promotes active engagement, conceptual understanding, and creative confidence, helping learners move from passive observation to authentic construction of knowledge through experimentation and iteration.
- **Original TODO:** Paragraph describing PRIMM methodology and how MicroSims guide students through this progression.
- **Impact:** Strengthens the pedagogical foundation by explicitly connecting MicroSims to a recognized computational thinking and programming education framework.
