Educational simulations have long been recognized as powerful tools for enhancing 
learning outcomes, yet their creation has traditionally required substantial 
resources and technical expertise. This paper introduces MicroSims a novel 
framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations 
that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally 
embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without 
programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection 
of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable 
AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides 
universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable 
code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. 
We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, 
technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. 
Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses 
across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can 
improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\% compared to traditional 
instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent 
barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. 
This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost 
intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to 
create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand. 
We discuss implementation considerations, present evidence of effectiveness, 
and outline future directions for AI-powered adaptive learning systems built 
on the MicroSim foundation.
