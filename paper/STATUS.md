   - Verify BibTeX formatting
   - Ensure all \cite{} commands match bib entries

3. **Create Core Figures** (Est. 3-4 hours)
   - Architecture diagram (essential)
   - Venn diagram - can export from microsim-uniqueness!
   - Effectiveness data visualization (essential)
   - Workflow diagram
   - Responsive design comparison

### Medium Priority (Improves Quality)

4. **Polish and Refinement** (Est. 2-3 hours)
   - Ensure consistent terminology
   - Check all cross-references
   - Verify section flow
   - Add transitions between sections
   - Check for redundancy

5. **Code Listings** (Est. 1 hour)
   - Add 2-3 key code examples
   - Format with listings package
   - Add explanatory captions

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

6. **Additional Figures** (Est. 2-3 hours)
   - Metadata schema diagram
   - Subject area distribution chart
   - Additional technical diagrams

## Current Paper Metrics

- **Sections**: 11 (all created)
- **Estimated current length**: ~8-10 pages (with content extraction: 15-18 pages)
- **References**: 20 (target: 50-80)
- **Figures**: 0 (target: 5-7)
- **Tables**: 0 (optional: 1-2)

## Compilation Status

- ✅ LaTeX structure valid
- ⚠️ Not yet tested (requires LaTeX installation or Overleaf)
- ✅ All \input{} paths correct
- ✅ BibTeX file structure valid
- ⚠️ Some undefined citations (need to add to .bib)

## Next Immediate Steps

### Step 1: Upload to Overleaf (30 minutes)
1. Create Overleaf account (if needed)
2. Create new project
3. Upload all files from `paper/` directory
4. Set main.tex as main document
5. Compile to check for errors
6. Share project link

### Step 2: Content Extraction Priority (4-6 hours)
Focus on highest-impact sections first:

**Priority 1**: Section 9 (Effectiveness)
- Most data-rich
- Strongest empirical evidence
- Key differentiator for academic paper

**Priority 2**: Section 5 (Design Framework)
- Core contribution
- Framework is novel
- Comprehensive guidelines

**Priority 3**: Sections 6 & 7 (Architecture & Metadata)
- Technical details
- Implementation specifics
- Reproducibility

**Priority 4**: Sections 4 & 8 (Definition & Workflow)
- Supporting sections
- Contextual information

**Priority 5**: Section 10 (Discussion)
- Synthesis section
- Can draft after other sections complete

### Step 3: Create Essential Figures (2-3 hours)
**Must-have figures**:
1. Venn diagram (easy - export from MicroSim!)
2. Architecture diagram (use draw.io or similar)
3. Effectiveness bar chart (create from research data)

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimate
- **Minimum viable paper**: 10-12 hours
- **High-quality submission**: 15-20 hours
- **Comprehensive with all figures**: 20-25 hours

### Tools Needed
- ✅ Text editor (available)
- ⚠️ LaTeX compiler (use Overleaf)

- ⚠️ Data visualization tool (Python/matplotlib, Excel, R)
- ✅ BibTeX manager (optional but helpful)

### Skills Needed
- ✅ LaTeX knowledge (basic - structure is in place)
- ✅ Academic writing (yes - source content is academic)
- ⚠️ Figure creation (moderate - for diagrams)
- ✅ Reference management (basic)

---

**Bottom Line**: The paper framework is complete and ready for content extraction. The hardest structural work is done. Now it's a matter of systematically extracting and converting the existing high-quality documentation into LaTeX format, creating a few key figures, and polishing for submission.

**Estimated time to submittable paper**: 10-15 hours of focused work.

**Current completion**: ~40% (structure and key sections complete)
**With content extraction**: ~85% (needs figures and references)
**Final submission ready**: ~100% (with polish and figures)
