  Medium Priority Figures

  5. Development Workflow Diagram (Section 8)

  Purpose: Show the AI-assisted creation process

  Content: Flowchart with these stages:
  1. Discovery: Educator searches repository (faceted search)

  4. Preview: Real-time testing in browser
  5. Refinement: Iterative modifications via prompts
  6. Metadata: Auto-generated JSON metadata
  7. Deployment: Integration to LMS/intelligent textbook

  Include feedback loops between preview ↔ refinement

  Suggested tool: draw.io, Lucidchart, or Mermaid
  File: figures/workflow-diagram.pdf

  6. Metadata Schema Hierarchy (Section 7)

  Purpose: Visualize the metadata structure

  Content: Tree/hierarchy diagram showing:
  - Root: MicroSim Metadata
    - Dublin Core (title, creator, subject, description...)
    - Educational (grade level, subject area, learning objectives, Bloom's taxonomy)
    - Technical (framework, dimensions, dependencies, accessibility)
    - User Interface (controls array: sliders, buttons, checkboxes)
    - Simulation (model type, variables, equations)
    - Analytics (xAPI events, learning indicators)

  Suggested tool: draw.io, yEd, or TikZ
  File: figures/metadata-schema.pdf

  7. High-Impact Application Categories (Section 9)

  Purpose: Show breadth of MicroSim applications

  Content: Grid layout (2×3 or 3×2) with example screenshots:
  - Physics & Engineering: Circuit simulation, forces & motion
  - Chemistry: Molecular bonding, pH simulation
  - Biology: Ecosystem dynamics, cell processes
  - Mathematics: Function grapher, probability simulator
  - Systems Thinking: Causal loop diagram, stock-flow model
  - (Optional 6th): Computational thinking

  Each with thumbnail image and caption

  Suggested tool: Composite image in Figma/Photoshop, or LaTeX subfigure
  File: figures/application-categories.pdf

  Lower Priority Figures

  8. PhET Usage Statistics (Section 9)

  Purpose: Show scale and global reach

  Content:
  - World map with heat overlay showing 175 countries
  - Callout box: "45 million runs annually"
  - Small bar chart: usage by grade level or subject area

  Suggested tool: Python (plotly, folium) or data visualization tool
  File: figures/phet-usage-map.pdf

  9. Code Example with Annotations (Section 6)

  Purpose: Show the standardized code structure

  Content: Annotated code listing showing:
  // Canvas dimensions (annotated)
  let canvasWidth = 400;
  let drawHeight = 400;      // ← Simulation area
  let controlHeight = 50;    // ← Controls area

  function setup() {         // ← Standard p5.js
    canvas = createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
    canvas.parent('main');   // ← iframe integration
  }

  function draw() {          // ← Separation of concerns
    // Draw area (visualization)
    fill('aliceblue');
    rect(0, 0, width, drawHeight);

    // Control area (UI)
    fill('white');
    rect(0, drawHeight, width, controlHeight);
  }

  Suggested tool: LaTeX listings package (already in your preamble)
  File: Inline code, no separate figure needed

  10. Bloom's Taxonomy Integration (Section 5)

  Purpose: Show pedagogical alignment

  Content: Pyramid diagram:
  - Base → Top: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create
  - Arrows showing how different MicroSim features support each level
  - Examples mapped to each level

  Suggested tool: draw.io or PowerPoint
  File: figures/blooms-taxonomy.pdf

  Quick Creation Strategy

  Easiest to create first:
  1. Venn Diagram - Export from your existing MicroSim
  2. Effectiveness Chart - Simple bar chart with your data
  3. Architecture Diagram - Basic layered diagram

  Most impactful for reviewers:
  1. Architecture Diagram (shows technical innovation)
  2. Effectiveness Chart (shows empirical evidence)
  3. Workflow Diagram (shows practical process)
  4. Venn Diagram (shows uniqueness/positioning)

  Recommended minimal set (if time-constrained):
  - Architecture Diagram
  - Effectiveness Chart
  - Venn Diagram
  - Workflow Diagram

  These four figures would give reviewers a complete visual understanding of what MicroSims are
  (Venn), how they work technically (Architecture), how they're created (Workflow), and why they
  matter (Effectiveness).
