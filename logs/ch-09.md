# Chapter 9 Generation Session Log

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Chapter:** 09-blooms-taxonomy-and-learning-objectives
**Skill Used:** chapter-content-generator v0.03
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.5

## Session Summary

Generated comprehensive content for Chapter 9: "Bloom's Taxonomy and Learning Objectives" with emphasis on using Bloom's Taxonomy as a systematic map for matching learning objectives to appropriate MicroSim types.

## User Request

> Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 9. Tell the student that there are huge variations in learning objectives. Without some guidance it would be hard to pick what type of MicroSim to design for a given type of learning objective. That is where the Bloom taxonomy comes in. It serves as a way to map a learning objective to a specific type of MicroSim.

## Admonitions Used

1. **tip** - "The Power of Classification" - Bloom's as systematic guide
2. **question** - "Challenge: Classify and Select" - apply to real course

## Files Modified

- `/docs/chapters/09-blooms-taxonomy-and-learning-objectives/index.md` - Complete rewrite with generated content

## Skills Required for Implementation

| Element | Skill Needed |
|---------|-------------|
| Interactive Bloom's Pyramid MicroSim | `microsim-p5` |
| Ohm's Law Circuit Simulator MicroSim | `microsim-p5` |
| Network Explorer MicroSim | `microsim-p5` or `vis-network` |
| Ecosystem Model Editor MicroSim | `microsim-p5` |
| Bloom's Taxonomy Timeline | `timeline-generator` |
| MicroSim Selection Flowchart | `mermaid-generator` |

## Next Steps

1. Implement the 4 MicroSims + 2 diagrams using appropriate skills
2. Generate Chapter 10 content (Charts, Diagrams, and Infographics)
3. Consider creating a Bloom Level Quiz MicroSim for assessment

## Notes

- This is a foundational pedagogical chapter - concepts apply to all future MicroSim design
- Strong emphasis on practical application through Selection Matrix
- Each cognitive level gets dedicated MicroSim example showing that level
- Classification practice built into chapter content
- References include both academic sources (Anderson, Bloom) and practical resources
