# Chapter 14 Generation Session Log

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Chapter:** 14-professional-development-and-capstone
**Skill Used:** chapter-content-generator v0.03
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.5

## Session Summary

Generated comprehensive content for Chapter 14: "Professional Development and Capstone" with emphasis on collaborative team development over isolated "cowboy" programming, and the importance of building robust, reusable MicroSim libraries together.

## User Request

> Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 14. It is my sincere hope that students are not just isolated "cowboy" (or cowgirl) programmers that believe that the only path to success in your career is to work alone. My prediction is that the greatest interactive intelligent books full of beautiful MicroSims will be created by teams of people working together to build libraries of MicroSims that are robust, reusable and are easily customized by both people and intelligent agents. This chapter is about how you can work in teams to build projects collaboratively with others. Remembering to do a 'git pull' before you start writing code is an important habit to build even when you are working in isolation.
