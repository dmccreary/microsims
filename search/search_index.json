Students use AI to generate the initial code and then perform a detailed walkthrough of the program's major sections: global variables, the <code>setup()</code> function, and the <code>draw()</code> function. Students then add interactive controls to allow users to start, stop, and pause the simulation, as well as adjust parameters like speed.</p> <p>Building on this foundation, students explore more complex simulations such as projectile motion by introducing variables for angle and power. The course establishes a standard MicroSim layout consisting of a drawing region and a control region, providing a consistent user experience across all simulations. Students are then encouraged to explore the generation of simulations on their own using tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLM tools.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#from-learning-objective-to-microsim","title":"From Learning Objective to MicroSim","text":"<p>We then take a look at the problem of how to generate the right MicroSim for a specific learning objective. We create a scenario where an AI agent is building a customized textbook for a class, a project, or an individual student. After it generates a learning graph and partitions the graph into chapters, it is time to generate the content. As content is being generated there are opportunities for the agent to insert diagrams, charts, and even small in-line simulations to help a student with a learning objective. But how do we design a MicroSim for the many types of learning objectives? This is where we turn to methods of classifying learning objectives into categories. These categories will give us insights into what MicroSim to use.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#blooms-2001-taxonomy","title":"Bloom's 2001 Taxonomy","text":"<p>We first cover the most common way to classify learning objectives. For this we use the 2001 Bloom taxonomy. We go into a quick background of how the original Bloom taxonomy was created and how it was refined in 2001. The six categories of learning objectives are:</p> <ul> <li>L1: Remember (recall facts) - bottom level of a pyramid</li> <li>L2: Understand (explain concepts)</li> <li>L3: Apply (use knowledge to solve a problem)</li> <li>L4: Analyze (examine relationships, connect concepts)</li> <li>L5: Evaluate (judge value)</li> <li>L6: Create (design new solutions) - top level of a pyramid</li> </ul> <p>What we find is that when objectives are at a specific level, the types of MicroSims we use are different from the MicroSims we use at other levels. For example, getting students to recall facts (L1) might use a flash-card game with rewards and repetition based on reinforcement learning theory. On the other hand, a Create-level objective might involve the user constructing a small model and checking that the model follows the concepts learned in the course.</p> <p>Once we select a learning objective we can classify it in one of the levels of Bloom's taxonomy. That then guides us on the types of interactive simulations that would be the most effective.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#objective-microsim-skill-matching","title":"Objective MicroSim Skill Matching","text":"<p>Although there are many types of MicroSims, in practice we will only need about a dozen types for a typical high-school course such as algebra, geometry, physics, or history.

We will be demonstrating examples of these MicroSims in this course.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#managing-microsim-metadata","title":"Managing MicroSim Metadata","text":"<p>One of the key ways that generative AI can be successful at creating new MicroSims is if it has a large library of working MicroSims that are already classified based on subject, Bloom level, and JavaScript library used. Generative AI can often begin with a working MicroSim and make small modifications such as adding a new slider control or removing controls. The key to this process is to have a precise and standardized way to describe each MicroSim. A database of MicroSims can then be put into a faceted search system where only MicroSims that meet specific criteria can be returned as search results. We use the phrase \"you can't reuse what you can't find\" as a way to focus on good metadata and search.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#challenges-with-generating-layouts","title":"Challenges with Generating Layouts","text":"<p>One of the largest challenges in using generative AI is to appreciate the fact that LLMs don't have a world model of a user interface.

Adapting MicroSims to respond to changes in container width takes special care when elements are placed on a canvas. Instead of absolute coordinate positions, relative sizes are used. For example, instead of placing a title at <code>(x=200, y=50)</code> we would place the title at <code>(x=canvasWidth/2, y=margin)</code> to keep the title centered at the top of the MicroSim.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#grouping-elements","title":"Grouping Elements","text":"<p>In order to make it easy for AI tools (and humans) to move groups of drawing elements around together, we often design our MicroSims using <code>push()</code>, <code>translate()</code>, and <code>pop()</code> functions.

While these technologies have demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing student engagement and comprehension, they often suffer from limitations in accessibility, scalability, and pedagogical integration. This paper positions Educational MicroSims as a distinct category of learning technology that addresses these limitations while maintaining the interactive benefits of more complex simulation environments.</p> <p>Educational MicroSims represent a paradigm shift in how interactive educational content is conceptualized, developed, and deployed. Unlike traditional educational simulations that require substantial technical infrastructure and specialized expertise, MicroSims are designed as lightweight, browser-based applications that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence and easily customized by educators without programming knowledge. This positioning paper examines how MicroSims differentiate from existing educational technologies and articulates their unique value proposition within the broader ecosystem of digital learning tools.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/microsims-in-the-ed-tech-landscape/#differentiation-from-existing-educational-simulations","title":"Differentiation from Existing Educational Simulations","text":"<p>Traditional educational simulations, such as PhET Interactive Simulations from the University of Colorado (Wieman et al., 2008) or NetLogo models from Northwestern University (Wilensky, 1999), represent sophisticated educational tools that have proven effective in science and mathematics education. However, these platforms are characterized by several limitations that MicroSims explicitly address. First, traditional simulations typically require significant development resources, specialized programming expertise, and ongoing maintenance to ensure compatibility across evolving web technologies. In contrast, MicroSims employ standardized architectural patterns that enable automated generation through large language models, dramatically reducing development time and technical barriers.</p> <p>Second, existing simulation platforms often implement comprehensive feature sets that, while powerful, can overwhelm both educators seeking to integrate specific concepts and students encountering cognitive overload. MicroSims adopt a deliberately constrained approach, focusing on specific learning objectives with minimal extraneous functionality. This constraint-based design philosophy aligns with cognitive load theory principles (Sweller, 1988), which suggest that learning is optimized when instructional materials minimize irrelevant cognitive processing.</p> <p>Third, traditional educational simulations frequently operate as standalone applications with limited integration capabilities. MicroSims are architected from the ground up for embedding within larger educational ecosystems, including intelligent textbooks, learning management systems, and adaptive learning platforms. This integration-first approach enables seamless incorporation into existing curricula without requiring educators to adopt entirely new technological infrastructures.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/microsims-in-the-ed-tech-landscape/#distinction-from-interactive-textbooks-and-digital-learning-materials","title":"Distinction from Interactive Textbooks and Digital Learning Materials","text":"<p>The interactive textbook market has evolved considerably, with platforms such as Pearson MyLab (Pearson Education, 2023), McGraw-Hill Connect (McGraw-Hill Education, 2023), and Wiley WileyPLUS (Wiley, 2023) offering multimedia-enhanced learning experiences. However, these platforms typically employ pre-authored interactive elements that cannot be easily modified or extended by individual educators. MicroSims fundamentally differ by providing a generative approach to interactive content creation, where simulations are produced on-demand to address specific pedagogical requirements.</p> <p>Furthermore, commercial interactive textbook platforms operate under proprietary licensing models that limit institutional flexibility and long-term sustainability. MicroSims, by contrast, generate open-source code that institutions can freely modify, redistribute, and maintain independently. This open architecture ensures that educational investments in MicroSim-based content remain viable regardless of vendor relationships or platform evolution.</p> <p>The pedagogical integration model also differs significantly. Traditional interactive textbooks embed predetermined interactive elements at fixed locations within the content structure. MicroSims enable dynamic content generation that can respond to real-time assessment of student understanding, creating personalized learning pathways that adapt to individual student needs and preferences.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/microsims-in-the-ed-tech-landscape/#positioning-relative-to-learning-management-systems-and-virtual-laboratories","title":"Positioning Relative to Learning Management Systems and Virtual Laboratories","text":"<p>Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Canvas (Instructure, 2023), Blackboard (Blackboard Inc., 2023), and Moodle (Moodle Pty Ltd., 2023) provide comprehensive platforms for course delivery and student management but rely heavily on external content providers for interactive educational materials. MicroSims complement existing LMS infrastructure by providing a standardized method for generating and deploying interactive content directly within these platforms. The lightweight architecture of MicroSims ensures compatibility across different LMS implementations without requiring platform-specific adaptations.</p> <p>Virtual laboratory platforms, including Labster (Labster ApS, 2023) and Beyond Labz (Beyond Labz Inc., 2023), offer sophisticated simulation environments for science education but typically require subscription-based access and specialized hardware resources. MicroSims provide an alternative approach that prioritizes accessibility and scalability over comprehensive simulation fidelity. While virtual laboratories excel in providing high-fidelity replications of complex scientific processes, MicroSims focus on isolating and illustrating specific conceptual relationships that support understanding of fundamental principles.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/microsims-in-the-ed-tech-landscape/#technological-architecture-and-implementation-philosophy","title":"Technological Architecture and Implementation Philosophy","text":"<p>The technical architecture of MicroSims represents a deliberate departure from conventional educational software design. Rather than implementing feature-rich applications with extensive configuration options, MicroSims employ a minimalist architecture that prioritizes code clarity, educational transparency, and modification accessibility. This approach enables educators and students to examine, understand, and modify the underlying simulation logic, transforming the technology from a black-box tool into a transparent educational resource.</p> <p>The responsive design framework employed by MicroSims ensures consistent functionality across diverse device types and screen sizes, addressing the increasing prevalence of mobile and tablet-based learning in educational contexts. This device-agnostic approach contrasts with many existing educational technologies that require specific operating systems or hardware configurations.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/microsims-in-the-ed-tech-landscape/#integration-with-artificial-intelligence-and-adaptive-learning","title":"Integration with Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Learning","text":"<p>Perhaps most significantly, MicroSims are specifically designed for integration with artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models capable of code generation. This design consideration enables the development of adaptive educational systems that can generate customized simulations in real-time based on student performance data, learning preferences, and curriculum requirements. Traditional educational simulations, developed through conventional programming approaches, cannot easily achieve this level of dynamic customization.</p> <p>The structured data output generated by MicroSim interactions provides rich datasets for learning analytics applications, enabling educational systems to make evidence-based decisions about content sequencing, difficulty adjustment, and remediation strategies. This data-driven approach to educational personalization represents a significant advancement over static interactive content that cannot adapt to individual student needs.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/microsims-in-the-ed-tech-landscape/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Educational MicroSims occupy a unique position within the digital learning technology ecosystem, addressing specific limitations of existing approaches while maintaining the proven benefits of interactive simulation-based learning.

As educational institutions increasingly seek flexible, sustainable approaches to technology integration, MicroSims offer a promising model that balances pedagogical effectiveness with practical implementation considerations.

Here are the most useful harmonies for MicroSim design:  | Harmony Type | Description | Best Use | |-------------|-------------|----------| | **Complementary** | Colors opposite on wheel | High contrast, emphasis | | **Analogous** | Adjacent colors | Harmony, natural feel | | **Triadic** | Three colors equally spaced | Vibrant, balanced | | **Split-Complementary** | Base + two adjacent to complement | Contrast with less tension | | **Monochromatic** | Single hue, varying brightness | Elegant, cohesive |  ### HSB Color Mode: The Rainbow's Best Friend  While RGB is intuitive for mixing light, **HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness)** is far superior for creating rainbow effects and color harmonies.  <pre><code>colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100);  // Hue: 0-360\u00b0, Sat: 0-100%, Bri: 0-100%\n</code></pre>  | HSB Component | Range | Meaning | |--------------|-------|---------| | **Hue** | 0-360 | Position on color wheel (red=0, green=120, blue=240) | | **Saturation** | 0-100 | Color intensity (0=gray, 100=vivid) | | **Brightness** | 0-100 | Light level (0=black, 100=full brightness) |  ### Creating Rainbows with HSB  HSB makes rainbow generation trivially easy\u2014just loop through hue values!  <pre><code>function setup() {\n  createCanvas(400, 200);\n  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100);\n  noStroke();\n\n  // Draw rainbow bars\n  let barWidth = width / 360;\n  for (let h = 0; h &lt; 360; h++) {\n    fill(h, 100, 100);  // Full saturation and brightness\n    rect(h * barWidth, 0, barWidth + 1, height);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>  This simple loop creates a full spectrum rainbow! The magic is that hue values map directly to positions on the color wheel.  ## MicroSim: Your Personal Rainbow Generator  Now let's put everything together!

Here's how to think about composition:  ### Layered Construction  Build complex shapes from simple ones, drawing background elements first:  <pre><code>function drawButton(x, y, w, h, label) {\n  // Shadow layer (drawn first, appears behind)\n  fill(100);\n  noStroke();\n  rect(x + 3, y + 3, w, h, 8);\n\n  // Button body\n  fill(70, 130, 220);\n  stroke(50, 100, 180);\n  strokeWeight(2);\n  rect(x, y, w, h, 8);\n\n  // Button text (drawn last, appears on top)\n  fill(255);\n  noStroke();\n  textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);\n  textSize(16);\n  text(label, x + w/2, y + h/2);\n}\n</code></pre>  ### Creating Custom Shapes with beginShape()  For shapes beyond the primitives, use vertex-based drawing:  <pre><code>function setup() {\n  createCanvas(400, 300);\n  background(240, 248, 255);\n\n  fill(255, 200, 100);\n  stroke(200, 150, 50);\n  strokeWeight(2);\n\n  // Draw a star using vertices\n  beginShape();\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n    let angle = TWO_PI * i / 10 - HALF_PI;\n    let radius = (i % 2 === 0) ? 80 : 40;\n    let x = 200 + cos(angle) * radius;\n    let y = 150 + sin(angle) * radius;\n    vertex(x, y);\n  }\n  endShape(CLOSE);\n}\n</code></pre>  ## Practical Application: MicroSim Control Panel  Let's apply everything to create a reusable control panel pattern:  <pre><code>// Drawing a standard MicroSim control panel\nfunction drawControlPanel(y, height) {\n  // Panel background\n  fill(255);\n  stroke(200);\n  strokeWeight(1);\n  rect(0, y, width, height);\n\n  // Subtle top border\n  stroke(180);\n  strokeWeight(2);\n  line(0, y, width, y);\n}\n\nfunction drawLabeledSlider(label, value, x, y) {\n  // Label text\n  fill(60);\n  noStroke();\n  textSize(14);\n  textAlign(LEFT, CENTER);\n  text(label, x, y);\n\n  // Value display\n  textAlign(RIGHT, CENTER);\n  text(value.toFixed(1), x + 280, y);\n}\n</code></pre>  This pattern appears in nearly every MicroSim\u2014a clean white control area with labeled sliders showing current values.  ## Key Takeaways  Congratulations! You've completed the most colorful chapter in this book. Here's what you've mastered:  1. **Drawing Primitives** are your visual vocabulary: `rect()`, `ellipse()`, `line()`, and more.  2. **rect()** draws rectangles from the top-left corner (or center with `rectMode(CENTER)`), with optional rounded corners.  3. **ellipse()** draws from the center by default, with width and height parameters for circles and ovals.  4. **line()** connects two points, styled with `stroke()` and `strokeWeight()`.  5. **stroke()** sets outline color; use `noStroke()` to remove outlines entirely.  6. **Shape Rendering** follows painter's algorithm\u2014draw order determines layering.  7. **text()** displays strings, with `textSize()` for font size and `textAlign()` for positioning.  8. **Color Theory** helps you create harmonious palettes using complementary, analogous, and triadic relationships.  9. **HSB Color Mode** makes rainbows easy\u2014just loop through hue values from 0 to 360!  10. **Combining primitives** with thoughtful layering creates professional-looking interfaces.  ??? question \"Challenge: What HSB values would you use to create a sunset palette?\"     A sunset palette uses warm hues in the red-orange-yellow range (0-60\u00b0), with varying saturation (60-100%) and brightness (70-100%). Try: `fill(30, 90, 100)` for orange, `fill(0, 80, 90)` for coral, and `fill(50, 100, 100)` for golden yellow!  ## Next Steps  You now have the skills to create visually stunning MicroSims with complete control over shapes, text, and color. In the next chapter, we'll add **interactivity**\u2014sliders, buttons, and mouse events that let users explore simulations hands-on.  Go experiment with your new rainbow powers! Try creating:  - A color picker with HSB sliders - A drawing app with shape stamps - An animated rainbow that cycles through hues - A mood board with complementary color pairs - A text-based data display with styled labels  The canvas is your palette. Paint something wonderful!  ## References  For deeper exploration of color and design:  - [p5.js Color Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Color) - Complete color function documentation - [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) - Interactive color wheel and palette generator - [Coolors](https://coolors.co) - Fast palette generation tool - [Color Theory Fundamentals](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/color-theory) - Academic overview - [HSB vs RGB](https://learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html) - Practical guide to HSB"},{"location":"chapters/04-drawing-animation-and-color/quiz/","title":"Chapter 4 Quiz: Drawing, Animation, and Color","text":"<p>Test your understanding of drawing primitives, text rendering, and color theory for creating vibrant MicroSims.</p> <p>Instructions: Select the best answer for each question.

Understanding them helps you work effectively within the system's boundaries.\n\n### What is a Token?\n\nA **token** is roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words on average. However, tokenization varies:\n\n- Common words are often single tokens\n- Code symbols may be individual tokens\n- Unusual words may be split into multiple tokens\n\n### Token Limits by Model\n\n| Model | Input Limit | Output Limit |\n|-------|-------------|--------------|\n| GPT-4 | ~8,000-128,000 tokens | ~4,000 tokens |\n| GPT-4 Turbo | ~128,000 tokens | ~4,000 tokens |\n| Claude 3 | ~200,000 tokens | ~4,000 tokens |\n| Claude 3.5 | ~200,000 tokens | ~8,000 tokens |\n\n### Practical Implications\n\nFor MicroSim development:\n\n- A typical MicroSim is 100-300 tokens (~75-225 lines)\n- Your prompt + conversation history counts against input limit\n- Very long conversations may need to be restarted\n- Large reference files can quickly consume tokens\n\n!!! warning \"Token Management\"\n    If an LLM suddenly \"forgets\" earlier context or produces degraded output, you may have exceeded effective context limits. Start a fresh conversation with a clear prompt.\n\n## The Context Window: Your Working Memory\n\nThe **context window** is the total amount of text (in tokens) that an LLM can \"see\" at once\u2014your prompt, the conversation history, and any included files.\n\n#### Diagram: Context Window Visualization MicroSim\n\n&lt;details markdown=\"1\"&gt;\n    &lt;summary&gt;Context Window Visualization&lt;/summary&gt;\n    Type: microsim\n\n    Learning objective: Help students visualize how context window fills up during a conversation (Bloom: Understand, Analyze)\n\n    Canvas layout:\n    - Drawing area: 500x350 pixels\n    - Control area: 50 pixels\n\n    Visual elements:\n    - Large container representing context window (horizontal bar)\n    - Colored segments showing:\n      - System prompt (gray, fixed at left)\n      - User messages (blue blocks)\n      - AI responses (green blocks)\n      - Current prompt (yellow, at right)\n    - Percentage filled indicator\n    - Token count labels\n    - \"Danger zone\" marking near capacity (red gradient)\n\n    Interactive controls:\n    - Button: \"Add User Message\" (adds ~50 token blue block)\n    - Button: \"Add AI Response\" (adds ~200 token green block)\n    - Button: \"Clear Conversation\" (reset to just system prompt)\n    - Slider: \"Window Size\" (switch between 8K, 32K, 100K, 200K)\n\n    Behavior:\n    - Each button click adds a block to the context visualization\n    - Bar fills from left to right\n    - When approaching limit, warning appears\n    - When exceeded, oldest messages fade/compress\n    - Shows how conversation history accumulates\n\n    Educational annotations:\n    - \"System prompt always present\" label\n    - \"Older messages may be summarized\" when near capacity\n    - Current utilization percentage\n\n    Color scheme:\n    - System: gray (#666)\n    - User messages: blue (#4488FF)\n    - AI responses: green (#44AA66)\n    - Current prompt: yellow (#FFCC00)\n    - Danger zone: red gradient\n\n    Implementation: p5.js with button callbacks\n&lt;/details&gt;\n\n### Managing Context Effectively\n\nStrategies for working within context limits:\n\n- **Start fresh** for new topics rather than continuing long conversations\n- **Be concise** in your prompts\u2014remove unnecessary words\n- **Reference, don't repeat**\u2014say \"using the same pattern as before\" instead of re-explaining\n- **Chunk large tasks** into smaller, focused conversations\n- **Use files wisely**\u2014only include code sections you're actively working on\n\n## AI Hallucinations: When Your Partner Makes Things Up\n\n**AI hallucinations** occur when an LLM generates confident-sounding but incorrect information. For code generation, this might mean:\n\n- Inventing functions that don't exist\n- Using incorrect syntax for a library\n- Claiming features work in ways they don't\n- Fabricating API methods or parameters\n\n### Common p5.js Hallucinations\n\n| Hallucinated | Reality |\n|-------------|---------|\n| `createButton(\"text\", x, y)` | `createButton(\"text\")` then `button.position(x, y)` |\n| `circle(x, y, radius)` | `circle(x, y, diameter)` \u2014 it's diameter, not radius! |\n| `setBackground()` | Should be `background()` |\n| `slider.onChange(callback)` | Use `slider.input(callback)` or check in draw() |\n| `canvas.clear()` | Use `clear()` or `background()` |\n\n### Detecting Hallucinations\n\n1. **Test every code snippet** before trusting it\n2. **Verify function signatures** against official documentation\n3. **Be skeptical of unusual syntax** you haven't seen before\n4. **Cross-reference** with p5.js reference documentation\n5. **If it seems too easy**, it might be hallucinated\n\n!!! danger \"Always Verify\"\n    Never assume AI-generated code is correct. The most dangerous hallucinations are subtle\u2014code that almost works but has hidden bugs. Test thoroughly!\n\n## AI Limitations: Knowing What Your Partner Can't Do\n\nUnderstanding **AI limitations** helps you set realistic expectations and know when to rely on your own judgment.\n\n### What LLMs Cannot Do\n\n- **Execute code**: They predict what code should look like, but can't run it\n- **See output**: They can't view your canvas or see visual bugs\n- **Remember perfectly**: Long conversations may have inconsistencies\n- **Access the internet** (usually): They work from training data, not live information\n- **Guarantee correctness**: All output needs human verification\n- **Understand intent**: They respond to what you said, not what you meant\n\n### The \"World Model\" Problem\n\nLLMs lack a true understanding of how visual interfaces work. They can't \"see\" that:\n\n- A label overlaps a button\n- Colors clash visually\n- Animations are too fast or slow\n- Layout feels unbalanced\n\n**You** must be the visual judge. Run the code, evaluate the appearance, and provide specific feedback.\n\n### Limitations in MicroSim Development\n\n| Limitation | Impact | Workaround |\n|-----------|--------|------------|\n| No visual feedback | Can't see layout problems | Describe issues precisely |\n| No execution | Can't catch runtime errors | Test and report errors back |\n| Training cutoff | May not know newest p5.js features | Provide API documentation |\n| Context limits | May lose track in long conversations | Start fresh when needed |\n| Probabilistic output | May give different answers | Use consistent prompting |\n\n## Rules Files: Teaching Your Partner Your Preferences\n\n**Rules files** are documents that provide consistent context to an LLM about your project's standards, patterns, and preferences. They're like an instruction manual for your AI partner.\n\n### What Goes in a Rules File\n\nFor MicroSim development, a rules file might include:\n\n```markdown\n# MicroSim Development Rules\n\n## Canvas Standards\n- Default canvas: 400x400 pixels\n- Drawing area background: rgb(240, 248, 255) - Alice blue\n- Control area: 50px height, white background\n- Standard margin: 25 pixels\n\n## Variable Naming\n- Canvas dimensions: canvasWidth, drawHeight, controlHeight\n- Sliders: descriptiveNameSlider (e.g., speedSlider, gravitySlider)\n- Use camelCase for all variables\n\n## Code Structure\n1. Global variables at top\n2. setup() function\n3. draw() function\n4. Helper functions\n5. Event handlers (mousePressed, etc.)\n\n## Control Placement\n- Sliders positioned at: y = drawHeight + 15\n- Slider labels to the left of slider\n- Slider values displayed to the right\n\n## Required Elements\n- Always include describe() for accessibility\n- Always include comments explaining the simulation\n- Always use standard layout pattern\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"chapters/05-leveraging-generative-ai/#using-rules-files-effectively","title":"Using Rules Files Effectively","text":"<ol> <li>Start conversations by referencing or including rules</li> <li>Keep rules updated as your standards evolve</li> <li>Be specific\u2014vague rules get vague compliance</li> <li>Provide examples of correct implementation</li> <li>Organize by topic for easy reference</li> </ol>"},{"location":"chapters/05-leveraging-generative-ai/#skills-development-building-reusable-ai-workflows","title":"Skills Development: Building Reusable AI Workflows","text":"<p>Skills development refers to creating structured, reusable prompts and workflows that reliably produce high-quality outputs.

Just resize the browser window.</p> <p>Watch what happens to the interface. Do the elements move gracefully together, like dancers on a stage, flowing smoothly as the space contracts and expands? Or do they remain frozen like statues, rigidly pinned to the left edge of a vast, empty landscape?</p> <p>That simple test reveals everything about how much care went into the design. Amateur MicroSims look acceptable at one specific window size\u2014the size they were designed on\u2014but fall apart the moment the user resizes their browser or views them on a different device. Professional MicroSims adapt fluidly to any container, maintaining proportions, keeping elements aligned, and ensuring the experience remains excellent regardless of screen dimensions.</p> <p>The Responsive Mindset</p> <p>Every time you place an element on the canvas, ask yourself: \"Will this still look right if the window is twice as wide? Half as wide?\" If the answer is no, you're using the wrong positioning strategy.</p> <p>The key to this elegant dance lies in implementing responsive rules\u2014patterns where components intelligently change their positions, sizes, and relationships as the window is resized.

In this chapter, we move beyond simple charts to visualizations that reveal structure, connection, and flow.</p> <p>Have you ever tried to manually lay out an organizational chart? Perhaps you've spent hours arranging boxes, drawing lines, only to have the structure change the next week. Then you start over. It's slow. It's painful. And it doesn't scale.</p> <p>Fortunately, there are ways to automate the layout of complex structures. The origin story takes us back to Bell Labs in the 1980s, where a team created a product called GraphViz\u2014a collection of layout algorithms that could automatically arrange nodes and edges into readable diagrams. From that pioneering work, many generations of products evolved. Today, many of these layout algorithms are available through JavaScript libraries like vis-network.</p> <p>The Layout Algorithm Advantage</p> <p>When you let algorithms handle positioning, you can focus on what matters: the relationships. Add a node, remove an edge, reorganize departments\u2014the layout adapts automatically. That's the power we'll harness in this chapter.</p> <p>Let's explore how these algorithms work and how we can bring order to complex network diagrams to build fun and insightful MicroSims.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/11-maps-networks-and-timeline-visualizations/#network-graphs-visualizing-relationships","title":"Network Graphs: Visualizing Relationships","text":"<p>Network graphs (also called node-link diagrams) show entities as nodes and relationships as edges connecting them.

In this chapter, we explore the science of learning\u2014cognitive load theory, scaffolding strategies, and assessment integration\u2014so you can make informed decisions about feature complexity.

It was developed by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, who were then graduate students at the MIT Media Lab. The project began in 2001 and was officially launched in 2003.  Because of its widespread adoption by the open-source community, it is now supported by the Processing Foundation.</p> <p>The key ideas behind Processing include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Accessibility for Beginners: Processing was designed to serve as the first programming language for artists and designers. It simplifies many aspects of programming and graphics, making it more accessible and less intimidating for beginners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on Visual Output: The language is geared towards creating visual output, which is appealing to artists and designers. This visual focus makes programming more engaging and understandable for those who are more visually oriented.</p> </li> <li> <p>Educational Tool: Processing is widely used as a teaching tool in universities and schools. Its simplicity and immediate visual feedback make it an excellent resource for teaching the fundamentals of programming and digital art.  Immediate visual feedback is a key feature in helping students to learn to code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open Source and Community Driven: Processing is open-source, meaning that it's free to use and modify. This has led to a large, active community of users who contribute to its development and share their work, further enriching the tool's capabilities and resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extensibility and Libraries Processing is not just a language but also an integrated development environment (IDE). It supports extensibility through libraries, allowing users to expand its capabilities. These libraries can be used for a wide range of applications, from computer vision to 3D graphics, contributing to its versatility in creating simulations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ease of Creating Simulations: Processing simplifies the process of programming graphical simulations. Its straightforward syntax and rich set of drawing functions allow users to quickly prototype and visualize complex systems. This ease of use in creating interactive graphics and simulations is one of its most appealing aspects for artists, designers, and educators.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, Processing stands out for its focus on the arts and design, its ease of use, and its strong community support, all of which contribute to its popularity for creating simulations and visual arts projects.</p>"},{"location":"setup/02-system-prompt/","title":"Setting up a System Prompt","text":"<p>With ChatGPT you can set up a single system prompt for generating p5.js MicroSims.

Boyd noticed that American F-86 pilots had a much better kill ratio than pilots of the Soviet MiG-15, despite the MiG-15 being technically superior in many respects. He attributed this to the F-86's better visibility and hydraulic controls, which allowed pilots to observe and act more quickly, getting inside the enemy's decision cycle.</p> <p>Boyd's work became foundational in military strategy and has since been applied to numerous fields including business, sports, law enforcement, and cybersecurity.

PWM signals can also be used to change the brightness of an LED. This simulation has a slider that allows the user to change the \"duty cycle\" of a waveform.  The simulation is a bright green line on a black background, just like the old CRT oscilloscope displays.  ## Sample ChatGPT Prompt  !!! prompt   Generate a p5.js sketch file of a simulation of a static pulse width     modulation (PWM) waveform on a 600x300 canvas.   Add a range control slider to adjust the Duty Cycle of the waveform.   Make the default Duty Cycle be 50%.   The min should be 0% and the max should be 100%.   Place the range control slider at the bottom of the canvas.   Make the leftSliderMargin be 155.   Make sure the range control slider has a width of canvasWidth-leftSliderMargin-20 using the      style attribute.   At the end of the draw() function add a text() function that displays     the label and value of the duty cycle.  I have tested this prompt several times using GPT-4 and it seems to work very well except for the precise layout of the duty cycle label, value and slider positioning. I had to tweak these by hand.   ## Sample Response  <pre><code>/// Pulse Wave Modulation (PWM) simulation\n// Made to render like an old oscilloscope - lime green on black\n// Most of this sim was generated by GPT-4 with some cleanup on placement of the slider\nlet canvasWidth = 600;\nlet canvasHeight = 200;\nlet dutyCycleSlider;\nlet dutyCycle = 0.5; // Initialize to 50%\nlet cycles = 6;\nlet waveHeight = canvasHeight/3;\nlet leftSliderMargin = 155; // at 16 point font\n\nfunction setup() {\n  const canvas = createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);\n  // uncomment if you are placing in an HTML page\n  // canvas.parent('canvas-container');\n  textSize(16);\n\n  dutyCycleSlider = createSlider(0, 1, 0.5, 0.01); // Range from 0 to 1, default value 0.5, step size 0.01\n  dutyCycleSlider.position(leftSliderMargin, canvasHeight - 35); // Position slider\n  dutyCycleSlider.style('width', canvasWidth - leftSliderMargin - 20 + 'px'); // Set width of slider\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  background('black');\n\n  // Update duty cycle\n  dutyCycle = dutyCycleSlider.value();\n\n  // Set stroke for waveform\n  stroke('limegreen');\n  // disable the fill in the waveform\n  noFill();\n  // make the line be double wide\n  strokeWeight(2);\n\n  // Generate PWM waveform\n  beginShape();\n  for (let x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) {\n    // Map x to time period of waveform\n    let t = map(x, 0, width, 0, TWO_PI * cycles);\n\n    // Calculate value of waveform at this point in time\n    // Draw high if in duty cycle, low otherwise\n    let y = (sin(t) &gt; 2 * dutyCycle - 1) ? \n        2*height/3 : height/3; \n\n    // Add vertex to waveform\n    vertex(x, y);\n  }\n  endShape();\n\n  // Display duty cycle\n  fill('white');\n  noStroke();\n  // Display duty cycle as percentage\n  text(\"Duty Cycle: \" + nf(dutyCycle*100, 0, 0) + \"%\", 20, height - 20); \n}\n</code></pre>  ## Key Learnings from the Simulation  1. We can use the ```map()``` function to transform the x coordinate into the time period of a waverform (t.) 1. We can draw a square wave using a ```sin()``` function with a threshold test. 2. We can use the ```beginShape()``` and ```endShape()``` around as set of ```vertex()``` point placements to generate waveforms. 3. We can use the \"number format\" function [```nf()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/nf)  to display the percentage without a decimal point.  ## Lesson Plan  ### Lesson Plan Prompt  <pre><code>I have a webpage that simulates a pulse-width-modulation waveform. \nThe page has a slider that allows students to change the duty cycle from 0% to 100%.\nWhen the students change the slider, the waveform is updated with the duty cycle.\nGenerate a lesson plan for a 9th-grade robotics class that uses this simulation.\nFor follow up activities, we have Raspberry Pi Picos that we program with MicroPython.\nReturn the response in a single raw markdown file.\n</code></pre>  ### Lesson Plan: Understanding Pulse-Width Modulation in Robotics  #### Objective: Students will understand the concept of PWM and its application in controlling robotic components like motors and LEDs.  #### Materials Needed: - Computers with internet access for the PWM simulation webpage. - Projector for demonstrations. - Optional: Physical components such as a small motor, LED, and Arduino for real-world demonstration.  #### Duration: 1 hour  ### Lesson Outline:  #### 1. Introduction to PWM (15 minutes) - Begin with a brief overview of PWM and its significance in robotics. - Explain key terms: duty cycle, frequency, analog vs. digital signals.  #### 2. Demonstration of PWM Simulation (10 minutes) - Project the PWM simulation on the screen. - Show how changing the duty cycle affects the waveform. - Relate this to how it would affect a motor's speed or an LED's brightness.  #### 3. Hands-On Activity with the Simulation (20 minutes) - Students will use the simulation on their computers. - Tasks:   - Set the duty cycle to various levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and observe changes.   - Students note their observations regarding the waveform changes.  #### 4. Real-World Application Discussion (10 minutes) - Discuss how PWM is used in real-world robotics. - If available, demonstrate using a motor or LED with an Arduino. - Encourage students to think of examples where PWM might be used in everyday technology.  #### 5. Reflection and Q&amp;A (5 minutes) - Encourage students to ask questions. - Discuss the importance of PWM in precise control in robotics.  ### Assessment: - Students will submit a brief report on their findings from the simulation. - Include a few quiz questions at the end of the session to gauge understanding.  ### Extension Activity: - For advanced students or as a follow-up lesson, introduce a Python program that uses PWM to control a motor speed using a motor driver chip such as an L293D or control an LED brightness.  ### Notes: - Ensure that all students understand the basic concepts before moving to the hands-on activity. - Assist students who might have difficulty with the simulation or concepts. - Encourage group discussions and peer learning."},{"location":"sims/pythagorean-theorem/","title":"Pythagorean Theorem MicroSim","text":"<p>Run the Pythagorean Theorem Fullscreen Edit this Pythagorean Theorem Using the p5.js Editor</p> <p>Add the following to your website to include this MicroSim in your course:</p> <pre><code>&lt;iframe src=\"http://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/sims/pythagorean-theorem/main.html\" height=\"470px\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This MicroSim demonstrates the Pythagorean Theorem, one of the most famous theorems in geometry.

In setup(), the canvas is created, and the slider is initialized. draw() continuously updates the canvas, translating the origin to the bottom center and then drawing the tree. drawBranch(len) is the recursive function. It draws a line, then moves to the end of that line. If the branch is long enough, it draws two smaller branches at angles determined by the slider. This code provides a basic recursive tree.

In virtual labs, learners can quickly try multiple setups (e.g. adjusting gravity, mixing chemicals, tuning parameters) and observe results, fostering scientific inquiry and problem-solving skills. The combination of interactive control, instant feedback, and intuitive visuals makes MicroSims a powerful tool for engaging students and improving their conceptual understanding across STEM disciplines.</p>"},{"location":"why/deep-research-final/#how-students-interact-with-microsims","title":"How Students Interact with MicroSims","text":"<p>Students typically interact with MicroSims through guided exploration and playful experimentation. Effective simulations are designed with an intuitive interface (minimal text, familiar objects, drag-and-drop controls) so learners of various ages can start exploring immediately (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). For instance, PhET simulations use everyday objects (bulbs, beakers, bicycles) as icons, helping students connect science concepts to prior knowledge (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). As students manipulate a sim \u2013 turning dials, sliding sliders, toggling settings \u2013 the simulation responds instantly with animated changes (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). </p> <p>This interactivity invites learners to ask \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d and see the consequences in real time. Studies of classroom use find that students often play with a simulation at first, then gradually focus on the underlying science as they notice patterns and cause-effect relationships (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). </p> <p>Critically, the level of guidance accompanying a sim influences how deeply students engage. Too much step-by-step instruction can lead to shallow follow-the-directions behavior, whereas completely unguided \u201cfree play\u201d might leave students unsure what to do (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). </p> <p>The optimal approach is to provide minimal but strategic scaffolding \u2013 for example, a couple of open-ended questions or challenges that nudge students to investigate key features (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). </p> <p>Research comparing activity designs found that \u201cgentle guidance\u201d (targeted prompts to explore certain controls) yielded better student reasoning than either an overly scripted lab or a totally open task (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). With light guidance, students engage in self-directed inquiry: they form predictions, test them in the sim, observe outcomes, and iterate. In interviews, students describe using sims to build a mental framework of the concept, essentially learning by doing in a virtual environment (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). This exploratory interaction is often accompanied by peer discussion as students work in pairs or small groups at a computer, debating what they see and challenging each other\u2019s ideas (similar to how they\u2019d collaborate in a hands-on lab). Notably, because simulations remove the fear of breaking real equipment or getting hurt, students tend to be more adventurous \u2013 clicking buttons, resetting conditions, trying extreme values \u2013 which leads to rich learning moments (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). In one study, learners using a circuit sim \u201cexplored and investigated without needing much assistance,\u201d unlike peers with real apparatus who were nervous about breaking something (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Overall, students interact with MicroSims in a highly engaged, trial-and-error manner, and with thoughtful design and minimal guidance, this interaction becomes a productive form of active learning.</p>"},{"location":"why/deep-research-final/#effectiveness-across-grade-levels-5th-grade-to-college","title":"Effectiveness Across Grade Levels (5th Grade to College)","text":"<p>A major advantage of interactive simulations is their adaptability across a wide range of education levels. From upper elementary through college, appropriately tailored MicroSims can make age-appropriate learning more effective. Research shows that even young learners (10\u201312 year-olds) can benefit significantly from simulations when guided properly. In one case, fifth and sixth graders used an ecosystem simulation over several class sessions and showed \u201cconsiderable improvements\u201d in several systems-thinking skills afterward (ERIC - EJ833089 - An Investigation of the Potential of Interactive Simulations for Developing System Thinking Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study with Fifth-Graders and Sixth-Graders, International Journal of Science Education, 2009-Mar) (ERIC - EJ833089 - An Investigation of the Potential of Interactive Simulations for Developing System Thinking Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study with Fifth-Graders and Sixth-Graders, International Journal of Science Education, 2009-Mar). This demonstrates that complex ideas (like food webs or dynamic ecosystems) can be grasped by younger students if delivered via interactive, visual simulations. Middle school students, with their growing abstract reasoning, readily engage with sims for topics like basic physics, Earth science, or introductory algebra. By high school, simulations become a staple for science classes \u2013 e.g. exploring forces and motion, electricity, chemical reactions, or genetics \u2013 and are often used to supplement or replace physical lab experiments. In fact, high school and college instructors report using the same PhET simulations for similar conceptual goals (such as promoting understanding of fundamental principles or scientific inquiry), adjusting the surrounding activity to the learner\u2019s level (Examining the Use of PhET Interactive Simulations  in US College and High School Classrooms). The flexibility of sims allows teachers to use them in varied ways \u2013 from demos in a 5th-grade classroom to inquiry labs in AP Physics to concept visualizations in a college lecture.</p> <p>Across all levels, the core benefits remain consistent: simulations make learning interactive, visual, and student-centered. The difference lies in the complexity of content and scaffolding. Younger students may need simpler interfaces, more guidance, and contexts tied to everyday life (for example, a 5th-grade water cycle sim with cartoon graphics). Older students can handle more complex controls, quantitative data displays, and open-ended exploration (e.g. a college-level sim that lets them discover quantum energy levels). But fundamentally, the engaging nature of MicroSims works from elementary to higher education. Notably, most research to date has focused on secondary and post-secondary contexts, with fewer studies in early grades (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). This suggests a gap and an opportunity: developing more MicroSims for K\u20135 topics (and studying their impact) could yield high payoffs in those early years where hands-on resources are scarce. The same is true for special education settings \u2013 well-designed interactive sims might greatly help learners with special needs, though more research is needed in that arena (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). In summary, interactive simulations can be generalized as effective learning tools across educational levels. They should be designed with flexibility and accessibility in mind so that a broad spectrum of students \u2013 from a curious fifth grader to a college STEM major \u2013 can intuitively engage with the material and construct understanding.</p>"},{"location":"why/deep-research-final/#common-characteristics-of-the-most-effective-microsims","title":"Common Characteristics of the Most Effective MicroSims","text":"<p>Not all simulations are created equal. The highest-impact MicroSims tend to share a set of common design characteristics that maximize learning: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Intuitive, student-friendly interfaces: Effective sims use clean visuals, minimal text, and familiar metaphors so that students can jump in without extensive instructions (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Controls are straightforward (dragging, sliding, clicking) and respond instantly, creating a smooth \u201cdialogue\u201d between the student\u2019s actions and the simulation\u2019s feedback (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). An intuitive design reduces cognitive load and lets learners focus on the science, not the software. </p> </li> <li> <p>Use of familiar contexts and analogies: The best sims depict scenarios or objects that students recognize from everyday life (bikes, balloons, magnets, etc.) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Tying abstract concepts to concrete, familiar things helps students form mental connections. Analogies embedded in the sim (e.g. modeling electric current like water flow) can further aid understanding (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). This contextualization means students spend less time wondering \u201cwhat am I looking at?\u201d and more time asking \u201chow does this work?\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>Making the invisible visible: A hallmark of great STEM sims is their ability to show hidden processes and multiple representations. They visualize things that are normally invisible \u2013 electrons moving through a circuit, molecules colliding, fields radiating, forces acting \u2013 thereby demystifying abstract phenomena (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Many effective sims include toggles for different views (e.g. switching between a macroscopic view and a molecular view, or overlaying graphs and data) so students can link causes and effects across representations. By seeing the unseeable, learners can develop accurate mental models of scientific principles (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi).</p> </li> <li> <p>Interactive and responsive feedback: High-quality MicroSims are highly interactive and provide real-time feedback. Every student action (moving a slider, adding an object, changing a value) produces a dynamic response \u2013 graphs update, animations play, outcomes change \u2013 reinforcing the cause-and-effect relationship (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). This immediacy helps students learn through exploration and experimentation, much like playing with real-world objects. Many sims also build in \u201csoft boundaries\u201d or productive constraints that guide learners towards core concepts (for example, limiting extraneous details or unrealistic actions) (Using PhET simulations to replace real equipment in lab \u2013 Circuit Construction Kit) (Using PhET simulations to replace real equipment in lab \u2013 Circuit Construction Kit). These constraints focus attention on the important variables without overtly telling students what to do.</p> </li> <li> <p>Appropriate challenge and scaffolding: The most effective simulations hit a sweet spot between ease and challenge. They often include little puzzles or goal-oriented tasks implicit in the design (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) \u2013 for instance, an electricity sim might challenge students to light a bulb, or a gravity sim might invite them to achieve a stable orbit. Such challenges encourage curiosity. At the same time, the sim should allow open-ended play and discovery. Many top-tier sims are used with accompanying inquiry-based activities that provide light scaffolding (guiding questions, tips) without spoiling the fun of discovery (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). This balance ensures students remain in the productive zone of exploration \u2013 not frustrated by complexity, but also not just mindlessly clicking.</p> </li> <li> <p>Research-tested and refined: Another common feature is that these MicroSims are iteratively user-tested with students and educators. For example, the PhET simulations undergo extensive student interviews and classroom testing, with revisions made until students reliably grasp the intended concepts and find the interface intuitive (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). This kind of refinement, driven by education research, results in simulations that effectively target known misconceptions and difficult concepts. The end product is a sim that \u201celicits only correct concepts\u201d from learners because the design itself guides them toward the right understanding (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). In essence, the best MicroSims embed good pedagogy into the software.</p> </li> </ul> <p>When simulations exhibit these characteristics \u2013 intuitive design, real-world context, making the invisible visible, interactive feedback, balanced challenge, and research-based refinement \u2013 they become tremendously effective learning tools. Such sims engage students emotionally (through game-like fun and curiosity) and cognitively (through experimentation and visualization), resulting in deeper understanding. These features should be a blueprint for developing new high-impact simulations.</p>"},{"location":"why/deep-research-final/#evidence-of-usage-and-effectiveness","title":"Evidence of Usage and Effectiveness","text":"<p>Both quantitative and qualitative data underscore the effectiveness of interactive simulations in education. Usage statistics alone speak to their impact: for example, the popular PhET simulators (free online STEM sims) have been run tens of millions of times per year worldwide (Examining the Use of PhET Interactive Simulations  in US College and High School Classrooms), and usage surged even higher during recent years of remote learning. ExploreLearning\u2019s Gizmos platform similarly offers over 500 simulations for grades 3\u201312, reflecting widespread adoption in classrooms (Gizmos: Interactive STEM Simulations &amp; Virtual Labs). This broad usage is driven by positive results. Dozens of empirical studies have been conducted \u2013 many using pre- and post-test designs \u2013 and a majority conclude that students learn more with simulations than with traditional methods (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review) (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). For instance, in a controlled experiment with high school physics labs, students who used a circuit simulation outperformed their peers who used real circuit kits on later exam questions, despite having the same lesson otherwise (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Six weeks after the lesson, the sim group scored significantly higher on conceptual questions about circuits, indicating superior long-term retention (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Moreover, when both groups were eventually asked to build a physical circuit, the students trained on the sim were faster and more confident at the task than those who initially used real equipment (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). This suggests that well-designed MicroSims can transfer learning to hands-on skills \u2013 dispelling the notion that virtual labs are somehow less \u201creal\u201d or effective.</p> <p>Qualitative feedback from both students and teachers further highlights the value of MicroSims. Students often report that they enjoy using simulations and find them helpful for understanding difficult concepts. In interviews, many described simulations as giving them an intuitive feel for phenomena \u2013 \u201cI could really visualize the inner workings of the process,\u201d as one student said about a sim, adding that it taught them more than the lecture alone (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Another student noted a simulation \u201chelped me gain intuition about the topic\u2026 especially useful where it\u2019s normally not possible to directly observe the phenomenon\u201d (e.g. atoms moving or charges flowing) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Such testimonials illustrate how simulations can illuminate topics that students previously found opaque or intimidating. Teachers likewise observe that simulations increase student engagement: quiet students come alive when at the keyboard, and classes buzz with discussion around \u201cwhat happens if we try this?\u201d Many educators deliberately use sims to target known misconceptions \u2013 for example, letting students play with a gravity sim to confront their misunderstandings about mass and free-fall. In surveys of hundreds of teachers, the primary goals cited for using simulations include developing conceptual understanding and promoting inquiry in their students (Examining the Use of PhET Interactive Simulations  in US College and High School Classrooms). Teachers value that sims can be flexibly integrated into lectures, labs, or homework, and used with diverse learners from remedial to advanced levels (Examining the Use of PhET Interactive Simulations  in US College and High School Classrooms) (Examining the Use of PhET Interactive Simulations  in US College and High School Classrooms). </p> <p>From a broader perspective, meta-analyses and literature reviews reinforce these positive outcomes. A recent systematic review of 31 studies concluded that digital simulations (especially interactive ones) consistently yield improvements in students\u2019 conceptual knowledge, problem-solving skills, and engagement, across STEM subjects (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review) (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). The evidence is particularly strong in domains like physics and chemistry where visualizing abstract processes is key (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review) (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). It\u2019s also notable that in the worst-case comparisons, simulations perform on par with traditional instruction, and in the best cases they provide significant gains (Using PhET simulations to replace real equipment in lab \u2013 Circuit Construction Kit). Additionally, simulations can positively influence attitudes: several studies found that using MicroSims made students more interested in STEM and more confident in their ability to learn science (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review) (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). This motivational boost is hard to quantify but was evident in classrooms where students would continue tinkering with a sim even after an assignment, simply because it was fun and intriguing. In summary, the combined quantitative and qualitative data make a compelling case that interactive MicroSims are both well-utilized and highly effective educational tools. They improve learning outcomes, enhance engagement, and are beloved by students and teachers alike \u2013 a rare triple-win in education.</p>"},{"location":"why/deep-research-final/#high-impact-microsim-categories-and-development-priorities","title":"High-Impact MicroSim Categories and Development Priorities","text":"<p>Based on the research and current gaps, the following categories of interactive simulations emerge as the most impactful for STEM education. These are areas where existing sims have proven effective and where developing new MicroSims could yield significant educational gains:</p> <ul> <li> <p>1. Physics and Engineering Simulations: Physics has long been a fruitful domain for simulations, given its abstract concepts and invisible forces. Sims that cover classical mechanics (motion, gravity, energy), electromagnetism (electric circuits, fields, magnetism), waves (sound, light), and modern physics (quantum phenomena) have shown high impact on learning. They allow students to visualize forces and fields, slow down or pause motion, and experiment with parameters that are impossible to isolate in the real world (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). For example, circuit simulations let students see charge flow and instantly reconfigure circuits, leading to better conceptual understanding than using wires and bulbs alone (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). Similarly, engineering-oriented sims (e.g. building bridges or rockets) provide sandbox environments for design and experimentation. These physics/engineering MicroSims are highly engaging and have strong evidence of improving learning, so continuing to develop them (especially for topics that are hard to demonstrate in class, like magnetic fields or semiconductor physics) will yield great benefits.</p> </li> <li> <p>2. Chemistry and Molecular Simulations: Chemistry simulations allow students to enter the molecular world \u2013 to see atoms, molecules, and reactions that are otherwise invisible. High-impact examples include sims for chemical bonding, reactions and equilibria, gas laws, solutions and pH, and atomic structure. They often feature multiple representations (molecular animations alongside graphs of concentration or energy) which help students link the microscopic and macroscopic levels of chemistry (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi). These sims also provide a safe virtual lab for experiments that would be dangerous, expensive, or time-consuming (e.g. exploring reaction rates by instantly adjusting temperature or trying many different reactant combinations). Students can visualize how molecules collide and react, gaining an intuitive understanding of kinetics and equilibrium. Research indicates that such molecular-level simulations can correct misconceptions (like what dissolving really looks like) and improve conceptual grasp in chemistry courses (ncc9630-ofirst@ncc9630.dvi) (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). Developing new MicroSims for under-taught areas (for example, organic reaction mechanisms or environmental chemistry processes) could be especially impactful, as they would make challenging content far more accessible.</p> </li> <li> <p>3. Biology and Life Science Simulations: In life sciences, simulations help model processes that occur within organisms or ecosystems over time. Cell and molecular biology sims (e.g. gene expression, cellular respiration, protein synthesis) let students manipulate biological pathways and observe outcomes, aiding understanding of complex sequences and interactions. Human anatomy and physiology can also be explored via interactive models (for example, simulating the circulatory system or neural networks). These are safer and often more ethical than traditional dissection or lab experiments, while still providing a hands-on feel. At the larger scale, ecology and environmental science simulations (such as predator-prey population models, disease spread simulations, or climate change models) allow students to experiment with system variables and see long-term impacts in accelerated time. Such sims promote systems thinking by showing how changes in one part of a biological system affect the whole. For instance, a food web simulation might show what happens to an ecosystem if a species is removed or a parameter (like rainfall) changes. Biology MicroSims are engaging because they often connect to real-life issues (health, environment) and can incorporate game-like scenarios (e.g. maintain the balance of an ecosystem). There is qualitative evidence that students find these simulations memorable and insightful for grasping living systems (ERIC - EJ833089 - An Investigation of the Potential of Interactive Simulations for Developing System Thinking Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study with Fifth-Graders and Sixth-Graders, International Journal of Science Education, 2009-Mar). Expanding this category \u2013 especially simulations of genetics, evolution, and complex ecosystems \u2013 will significantly enhance STEM education, as these are areas students often struggle to visualize.</p> </li> <li> <p>4. Mathematics and Computational Simulations: Math-focused MicroSims help students visualize abstract mathematical concepts by turning them into interactive objects. Examples range from elementary-level sims (exploring fractions with pie charts that students can adjust) to advanced math (interactively graphing functions and seeing how parameters transform the curve). Algebra and geometry sims can let learners manipulate equations or shapes and immediately see changes, reinforcing concepts like slope, intercept, congruence, and so on. Probability and statistics simulations (e.g. virtual coin flips or sampling distributions) enable students to experiment with large trials in seconds, building intuition about randomness and data patterns. There is evidence that connecting math concepts to visual, manipulative representations improves understanding, especially for learners who struggle with purely symbolic math. Even computational thinking and computer science basics can be taught via simple simulations (for instance, guiding a robot through a maze to teach programming logic, or visualizing sorting algorithms). While math sims have not been as extensively researched as science sims, platforms like PhET and others do include many math interactives and teachers report positive outcomes in engagement. New development in this category \u2013 such as MicroSims for calculus concepts (like an interactive integral that accumulates area) or for linear algebra (visualizing vectors and matrices) \u2013 could greatly support math learning by making the invisible logic of math visible and fun. Ensuring these sims tie into real-world contexts (like using simulations to model financial literacy or engineering problems) can further boost their impact by showing students why math matters.</p> </li> <li> <p>5. Complex Systems and \u201cSystems Thinking\u201d Simulations: This category cuts across disciplines and is especially crucial for developing systems thinking skills. These MicroSims model complex, dynamic systems with multiple interconnected parts, often incorporating feedback loops and time evolution. Examples include environmental systems (climate models, water resource management, sustainability scenarios), economic or social systems (simulation of a small economy or a city\u2019s growth), and integrated science issues (like an energy grid simulation combining technology and physics). Such simulations allow students to tweak one part of a system and observe ripple effects on the whole, teaching them to think in terms of interactions and dependencies. Research with an ecosystem simulation for middle schoolers showed that students can improve in understanding system structures and interactions after working with the sim (ERIC - EJ833089 - An Investigation of the Potential of Interactive Simulations for Developing System Thinking Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study with Fifth-Graders and Sixth-Graders, International Journal of Science Education, 2009-Mar). However, it also highlighted challenges in grasping feedback loops (ERIC - EJ833089 - An Investigation of the Potential of Interactive Simulations for Developing System Thinking Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study with Fifth-Graders and Sixth-Graders, International Journal of Science Education, 2009-Mar), suggesting that more development is needed to help learners recognize cyclical cause-and-effect. High-impact system sims often visualize flows (of energy, matter, money, etc.) and accumulate changes over time (for example, a graph of population over years in an ecology sim). They encourage what-if analysis, letting students act as policy-makers or scientists: \u201cWhat if we add more predators? What if carbon emissions are reduced by 50%?\u201d By seeing outcomes play out, students learn about stability, equilibrium, and unintended consequences \u2013 key aspects of systems thinking (ERIC - EJ833089 - An Investigation of the Potential of Interactive Simulations for Developing System Thinking Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study with Fifth-Graders and Sixth-Graders, International Journal of Science Education, 2009-Mar) (ERIC - EJ833089 - An Investigation of the Potential of Interactive Simulations for Developing System Thinking Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study with Fifth-Graders and Sixth-Graders, International Journal of Science Education, 2009-Mar). Given the importance of tackling complex real-world problems, developing more MicroSims in this category (and making them accessible from secondary school onward) could have a profound educational impact. They not only teach STEM content but also help students develop a holistic thinking approach needed in many fields.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These categories represent where interactive simulations can have the most significant impact on teaching and learning. When planning the development of new MicroSims, we recommend prioritizing these areas, as they either address core conceptual bottlenecks in STEM learning or fill a gap in current simulation offerings. Additionally, within each category, attention should be paid to scaling the simulation\u2019s design to different age groups (with appropriate complexity and supports) and to aligning simulations with curriculum needs and real-world relevance.</p>"},{"location":"why/deep-research-final/#key-takeaways-and-recommendations","title":"Key Takeaways and Recommendations","text":"<p>In summary, interactive MicroSims have proven to be transformative tools across STEM education by increasing engagement, making complex concepts understandable, and fostering inquiry skills. Students interact with these sims through active exploration, benefiting from intuitive design and immediate feedback that help them construct knowledge. The most effective simulations share common traits that educators and developers should emulate: simplicity of use, rich visualizations (especially of invisible processes), real-time interactivity, and built-in scaffolds or challenges that guide learning. The evidence \u2013 from improved test scores and long-term retention to enthusiastic student testimonials \u2013 confirms that well-designed simulations can significantly enhance learning outcomes. </p> <p>Going forward, development of high-impact MicroSims should focus on the categories above, leveraging what we know about effective design. In particular, expanding simulation resources for early grades and complex system topics will address current gaps and potentially yield big gains in student understanding (Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review). It\u2019s also recommended to continue rigorous testing and research on new simulations to ensure they meet learning objectives and are usable by diverse student populations. By doing so, the next generation of interactive simulations will not only cover more content areas but also integrate seamlessly into teaching practices, from 5th-grade science classes to university engineering courses. </p> <p>Overall recommendation: invest in creating MicroSims that are engaging, research-backed, and aligned with difficult STEM concepts \u2013 especially in physics/engineering, chemistry, biology, math, and systems thinking domains \u2013 as these will have the greatest impact on student learning. Emphasize design features that empower students to learn through exploration, and provide teachers with the flexibility to use these tools in various instructional contexts. By following these guidelines, educators and developers can harness the full potential of interactive simulations to enrich STEM education and cultivate deeper systems thinking in learners, preparing them for the complex challenges of the modern world. </p>"},{"location":"why/impact-analysis/","title":"MicroSim Maximal Impact Analysis","text":"<p>Here is a use of the OpenAI ChatGPT Deep Research tool to help us focus on finding what MicroSims would have the maximal impact on education.</p>"},{"location":"why/impact-analysis/#research-prompt","title":"Research Prompt","text":""},{"location":"why/impact-analysis/#initial-deep-research-prompt","title":"Initial Deep Research Prompt","text":"<p>Prompt</p> <p>We represent a group of software engineers who have developed a framework for generative AI and agentic IDEs to quickly and efficiently generate classroom interactive simulations.
