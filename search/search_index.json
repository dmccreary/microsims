It was developed by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, who were then graduate students at the MIT Media Lab. The project began in 2001 and was officially launched in 2003.  Because of its widespread adoption by the open-source community, it is now supported by the Processing Foundation.</p> <p>The key ideas behind Processing include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Accessibility for Beginners: Processing was designed to serve as the first programming language for artists and designers. It simplifies many aspects of programming and graphics, making it more accessible and less intimidating for beginners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on Visual Output: The language is geared towards creating visual output, which is appealing to artists and designers. This visual focus makes programming more engaging and understandable for those who are more visually oriented.</p> </li> <li> <p>Educational Tool: Processing is widely used as a teaching tool in universities and schools. Its simplicity and immediate visual feedback make it an excellent resource for teaching the fundamentals of programming and digital art.  Immediate visual feedback is a key feature in helping students to learn to code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open Source and Community Driven: Processing is open-source, meaning that it's free to use and modify. This has led to a large, active community of users who contribute to its development and share their work, further enriching the tool's capabilities and resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extensibility and Libraries Processing is not just a language but also an integrated development environment (IDE). It supports extensibility through libraries, allowing users to expand its capabilities. These libraries can be used for a wide range of applications, from computer vision to 3D graphics, contributing to its versatility in creating simulations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ease of Creating Simulations: Processing simplifies the process of programming graphical simulations. Its straightforward syntax and rich set of drawing functions allow users to quickly prototype and visualize complex systems. This ease of use in creating interactive graphics and simulations is one of its most appealing aspects for artists, designers, and educators.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, Processing stands out for its focus on the arts and design, its ease of use, and its strong community support, all of which contribute to its popularity for creating simulations and visual arts projects.</p>"},{"location":"setup/02-system-prompt/","title":"Setting up a System Prompt","text":"<p>With ChatGPT you can set up a single system prompt for generating p5.js MicroSims.

Here's a basic outline of the code:</p> <p>Setup the Canvas: Initialize a 400x400 canvas using createCanvas(400, 400) in the setup() function. Create a Slider: Create a slider for the branch angle using createSlider() and position it on the canvas. Draw the Tree: Use a recursive function to draw the tree in the draw() function. The angle between branches will be controlled by the slider's value. Recursive Function: The recursive function will draw a line for the branch and then call itself twice to draw the two smaller branches at the specified angle.</p> <pre><code>let angleSlider;\n\nfunction setup() {\nconst canvas = createCanvas(400, 400);\ncanvas.parent('canvas-container');\nangleSlider = createSlider(0, TWO_PI, PI / 4, 0.01);\nangleSlider.position(10, height + 10);\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\nbackground(255);\nstroke(0);\ntranslate(width / 2, height);\ndrawBranch(100);\n}\n\nfunction drawBranch(len) {\nline(0, 0, 0, -len);\ntranslate(0, -len);\n\nif (len &gt; 4) {\npush();\nrotate(angleSlider.value());\ndrawBranch(len * 0.67);\npop();\n\npush();\nrotate(-angleSlider.value());\ndrawBranch(len * 0.67);\npop();\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this code:</p> <p>angleSlider is a global variable to hold the slider. In setup(), the canvas is created, and the slider is initialized. draw() continuously updates the canvas, translating the origin to the bottom center and then drawing the tree. drawBranch(len) is the recursive function. It draws a line, then moves to the end of that line. If the branch is long enough, it draws two smaller branches at angles determined by the slider. This code provides a basic recursive tree. You can enhance it with more features like changing the color, stroke weight, or the number of branches.</p>"},{"location":"sims/recursion-tree/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Google Gemini Demo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/resize-test/","title":"Resize Demo","text":"Figure caption. <p>Link to Resize Demo</p>"},{"location":"sims/resize-test/#about-this-microsim","title":"About this MicroSim","text":"<p>This MicroSim teaches us go into full-screen and back.</p> <pre><code>// resize test\nrsz = 20; // resize button size\n\nfunction setup() {\n// initial 600 wide and 400 high\nconst canvas = createCanvas(600, 400);\nvar mainElement = document.querySelector('main');\ncanvas.parent(mainElement);\ntextSize(16);\n}\n\n// draw the \"toggle full screen\" icon in the lower right corner\nfunction drawResize() {\nwR = width-rsz; // with less resize button width\nhR = height-rsz; // height less resize button width\nfill('white');\nrect(wR,hR,rsz,rsz);\nstroke('black')\n\nline(wR+4, hR+4, wR+4, hR+8); // ul v\nline(wR+4, hR+4, wR+8, hR+4); // ul h\n\nline(width-4, hR+4, width-8, hR+4); // ur v\nline(width-4, hR+4, width-4, hR+8); // ur h\n\nline(wR+4, height-4, wR+4, height-8); // ll v\nline(wR+4, height-4, wR+8, height-4); // ll h\n\nline(width-4, height-4, width-4, height-8); // lr v\nline(width-4, height-4, width-8, height-4); // lr h\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\nbackground('lightgray');\ndrawResize(); // draw the full screen toggle\nfill('black')\nnoStroke();\ntext(\"Window Width: \" + str(windowWidth), 10, 20)\ntext(\"Window Height: \" + str(windowHeight), 10, 50)\n}\n\n// If the mouse is pressed in the resize box, toggle full-screen mode.\nfunction mousePressed() {\nif (mouseX &gt; width-rsz &amp;&amp; mouseX &lt; width &amp;&amp; mouseY &gt; height-rsz &amp;&amp; mouseY &lt; height) {\n// get the current value (0,1)\nlet fs = fullscreen();\n// toggle the value\nfullscreen(!fs);\n}\n}\n\n// this works down to w=500 and h=254\nfunction windowResized() {\n// console.log('windowResized', windowWidth, windowWidth);\nresizeCanvas(windowWidth-20, windowHeight-35);\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"sims/robots/","title":"Collision Avoidance Robot","text":""},{"location":"sims/robots/#supporting-simulations","title":"Supporting Simulations","text":"<ol> <li>Battery Circuits</li> <li>Battery Drain</li> <li>Motor</li> <li>H-Bridge Circuit</li> <li>Pulse-Width Modulation</li> <li>Collision Avoidance Robot</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sims/seven-segment-display/","title":"7-Segment Display","text":"<p>Demo</p>"},{"location":"sims/sierpinski/","title":"Sierpinski","text":"Sierpinski Triangle"},{"location":"sims/sierpinski/#demo-1","title":"Demo 1","text":"<p>This demo draws colored triangles within triangles up to a depth of 7.
