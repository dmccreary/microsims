<p>Here is a use of the OpenAI ChatGPT Deep Research tool to help us focus on finding what MicroSims would have the maximal impact on education.</p>
<h2 id="research-prompt">Research Prompt</h2>
<h3 id="initial-deep-research-prompt">Initial Deep Research Prompt</h3>
<div class="admonition prompt">
<p class="admonition-title">Prompt</p>
<p>We represent a group of software engineers who have developed a framework for generative AI and agentic IDEs to quickly and efficiently generate classroom interactive simulations.  These interactive simulations, which we call MicroSims, run within a web browser and use the p5.js JavaScript library, which is ideal for running simulations and animations.  All our simulations have controls like sliders and buttons that require students to interact with the MicroSims.</p>
<p>Our goal is to start creating new MicroSims that will have the most impact in schools from 5th grade through college.  Please research what interactive simulations would be most beneficial for teachers.  Focus on finding specific types of interactive simulations that would have the maximum positive impact on our students.  Do not focus on any country or geography.  Include a wide range of subjects, including math, geometry, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, robotics, systems thinking, graph databases, graph data modeling, graph algorithms, data science, machine learning, deep learning, agentic AI, user experience design, explainable AI and user interface design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>After you have found strong evidence of what MicroSims have a high positive impact, analyze the common characteristics of these MicroSims.  Include factors such as how many students might use these MicroSims and how effectively they explain complex concepts.  Conclude with a list of the categories of MicroSims that will have the most significant impact on education.</p>

<p>I’d be happy to research this for you! To make sure the findings are as useful as possible, could you clarify the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you looking for research based on existing interactive simulations currently in use, or are you also interested in potential gaps where new simulations could have the most impact?</li>
<li>Do you want the analysis to focus more on student engagement, conceptual understanding, or both?</li>
<li>Would you like data on how teachers perceive the effectiveness of these simulations, or just how students interact with them?</li>
<li>Should the research focus more on STEM subjects, or should it also include humanities and other disciplines?</li>
<li>Would you like a breakdown of findings by education level (e.g., elementary, middle school, high school, college), or should it be generalized across all levels?
These details will help refine the research so it aligns closely with your objectives!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="my-response-to-clarification">My Response to Clarification</h3>

<li>look at research on both existing MicroSims and opportunities to fill gaps</li>
<li>Include both student engagement and conceptual understanding</li>
<li>Focus on how students interact with the MicroSims</li>
<li>Focus on STEM subjects.  Do not include humanities.  Include systems thinking.</li>
<li>Return results generalized across all levels.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="deep-research-response-to-clarification-response">Deep Research Response to Clarification Response</h3>
<p>Great! I will research the most impactful interactive simulations for education, focusing on existing MicroSims and identifying opportunities to fill gaps.

<p>The studies included in this review revealed several significant trends in the effectiveness and impact of simulations across various educational settings. A common finding was the positive influence of simulations on student attitudes and engagement. Simulations consistently enhanced students' interest and motivation in STEM subjects, often making abstract concepts more accessible and engaging, especially in fields like physics and engineering. Several studies noted improved student participation and enthusiasm, with certain methods, like augmented reality and online collaboration tools, leading to high levels of engagement.

<p>Digital Simulations in STEM Education: Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review
In terms of learning outcomes, simulations often led to better comprehension and knowledge retention compared to traditional methods. For example, students using computer-based simulations to study physics concepts, such as Newton's Second Law, showed a deeper understanding of these topics [15 ]. The integration of simulations with guided inquiry or interactive frameworks, like the KWL approach, further promoted critical thinking, reflective learning, and conceptual understanding [ 124].

<p>Research shows that substituting the PhET Circuit Construction Kit simulation for real equipment in a variety of contexts leads to improved conceptual learning in the best cases, and the same conceptual learning in the worst cases. There are many advantages to using PhET simulations over real equipment: They are easy to use, so students can play around and modify the experiment quickly and easily without fear of breaking the equipment. They have productive constraints to focus attention on the most important aspects of the experiment (e.g. bulb brightness and current flow) rather than on irrelevant aspects (e.g. wire color and length).

development of system thinking skills. The learning environment included interactive simulations using the Stagecast Creator software to simulate the ecosystem of a marsh. Simulations are an important tool in any effort to develop system thinking, because they have the potential to highlight the dynamic nature of systems. Before the implementation of the learning environment (over a period of five 90-min lessons) two written tests were administered to the students, investigating the development of seven aspects of system thinking. The same tests were administered after the implementation. Specifically, four of the tasks included in each test were associated with skills concerning the structure and the elements of a system and three were associated with the

The proposed learning environment provoked considerable improvements in some system thinking skills during a relatively brief learning process. However, the learning environment was not successful in promoting feedback thinking. We interpret these results in view of the difficulties encountered by the students. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the design of learning environments. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)

Simulations consistently enhanced students' interest and motivation in STEM subjects, often making abstract concepts more accessible and engaging, especially in fields like physics and engineering. Several studies noted improved student participation and enthusiasm, with certain methods, like augmented reality and online collaboration tools, leading to high levels of engagement.

Many studies aimed to understand how simulations impacted students' motivation, interest, and participation in STEM subjects, indicating a strong interest in simulations as a tool for increasing student involvement [13 , 121,19 , 113,28 , 136,39 , 138].

demonstrate that simulations help students' conceptual understanding about the phenomena. For example, one two hour lab of an algebra based physics course was divided into two groups---those that only used a simulation (CCK shown in fig. 4) and those that only used real equipment (bulbs, wires, resistors etc.). The lab activity written around the sim/equipment was identical otherwise. On the final exam (6 weeks later) three questions were

<p>that elementary school students have the potential to develop system thinking skills. The proposed learning environment provoked considerable improvements in some system thinking skills during a relatively brief learning process. However, the learning environment was not successful in promoting feedback thinking. We interpret these results in view of the difficulties encountered by the students.

Ecosystem of a marsh. Simulations are an important tool in any effort to develop system thinking, because they have the potential to highlight the dynamic nature of systems. Before the implementation of the learning environment (over a period of five 90-min lessons) two written tests were administered to the students, investigating the development of seven aspects of system thinking. The same tests were administered after the implementation. Specifically, four of the tasks included in each test were associated with skills concerning the structure and the elements of a system and three were associated with the processes and interactions taking place within a system. The findings indicated
