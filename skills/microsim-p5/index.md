The bouncing ball is the "Hello World!" of the Educational MicroSims.
It contains the key elements that shows the power of the width-responsive MicroSims
graphics with movement and user interaction.  When we design MicroSims, we also
want clearly-visible user interface elements in the control area that can control
the running of our simulations.  This version contains a slider to control the speed of the ball's movement.

## Lesson Plan

Here we would place the text for how the Bouncing Ball might be used in a classroom setting.
