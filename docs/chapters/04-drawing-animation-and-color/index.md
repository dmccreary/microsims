# Drawing, Animation, and Color

## Summary

This chapter expands your p5.js skills with drawing primitives, text rendering, and color theory. You will learn to use stroke() for outlines, rect() for rectangles, ellipse() for circles and ovals, and line() for connecting points. The chapter covers text display with text(), textSize(), and textAlign() functions, and explores shape rendering techniques. You will also develop a deeper understanding of color theory and how to apply it effectively in your simulations.
