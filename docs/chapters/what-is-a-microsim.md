# Definition of Educational MicroSims

We define an **Educational MicroSim** as a lightweight, standalone interactive simulation that executes within standard web browsers and is specifically designed for pedagogical applications. In this document we use the single word `MicroSim` for the full term `Educational MicroSim`.

MicroSims are characterized by the following key properties:

## Key Attributes of a MicroSim

### Technical Architecture
MicroSims are implemented as self-contained web applications, typically using [JavaScript](../glossary.md#javascript) [frameworks](../glossary.md#framework) such as [p5.js](../glossary.md#p5js), that require no external dependencies or [server](../glossary.md#server)-side infrastructure. They follow a standardized width responsive design pattern with distinct regions for visualization (drawing area) and user controls (interaction area).  The
layout of MicroSims can be expressed in a rules file that is used by generative AI systems.

### Educational Purpose
Each MicroSim targets specific learning objectives within a curriculum, enabling students to manipulate parameters and observe resulting changes in real-time. They support experiential learning by allowing learners to explore cause-and-effect relationships through direct interaction with underlying models or algorithms.

### Generative AI Integration
MicroSims are designed to be automatically generated by large language models such as GPT-4 or Claude, following standardized templates and design patterns. This enables rapid creation of domain-specific simulations aligned with particular educational content and learning objectives.

### Accessibility and Extensibility
The simulations are engineered for modification and extension by non-technical users including educators, students, and content creators. They employ consistent user interface conventions and well-documented code structures to facilitate customization without requiring advanced programming expertise.

### Learning Analytics Integration
MicroSims generate structured event streams capturing user interactions, parameter adjustments, and exploration patterns. These data streams can be analyzed to assess learning progress and provide feedback to adaptive educational systems, including intelligent textbooks that employ reinforcement learning to optimize the learning experience.

### Scalability and Distribution
Being [browser](../glossary.md#browser)-based and dependency-free, MicroSims can be easily distributed, embedded in various [learning management systems](../glossary.md#lms), and accessed across different devices and platforms without installation requirements.  Our goal
is to allow a MicroSim to be placed on any web page using a single [HTML](../glossary.md#html) `iframe` element.

## What MicroSims Are Not

To clarify the scope and boundaries of Educational MicroSims, it is important to establish what they explicitly are not:

### MicroSims Are Not Simple Free Running Animations
MicroSims are not simple animations of educational concepts.  Although generative AI can create beautiful animations, without some student action required for participation we cannot use feedback
and reinforcement learning in our intelligent textbooks.  Simulations must at a minimum contain controls
such as "Start" and "Pause" a simulation.  Monitoring who clicks these controls is critical for the development
of intelligent textbooks.

### Technology-Agnostic Implementation
MicroSims are not bound to any specific [JavaScript](../glossary.md#javascript) [library](../glossary.md#library) or [framework](../glossary.md#framework). While our implementation examples utilize [p5.js](../glossary.md#p5js) for its pedagogical clarity and ease of use, the MicroSim concept is library-agnostic and can be implemented using vanilla JavaScript, D3.js, Three.js, or any other web-based rendering technology that meets the functional requirements.

### Not Legacy Standards Compliance

MicroSims do not adhere to traditional e-learning standards such as [SCORM](../glossary.md#scorm) (Sharable Content Object Reference Model), AICC (Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee). These legacy standards impose architectural constraints and complexity that are incompatible with the lightweight, generative nature of MicroSims.  Note that because MicroSims 
all have interactive controls, they can be designed to easily work with xAPI standards but these standards are not required.  Generative AI can be used to automatically add xAPI calls to the controls area of a MicroSim.

### Not Comprehensive Simulation Environments
MicroSims are not intended to replace complex, full-featured simulation platforms or virtual laboratories. They are purposefully constrained in scope to address specific, well-defined learning objectives rather than attempting to model entire systems or domains.

## Metadata Strategy

MicroSims do leverage established [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) standards where appropriate. They incorporate [Dublin Core](../glossary.md#dublin-core) [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) elements for resource description, enabling proper cataloging, discovery, and interoperability within educational [repositories](../glossary.md#repository) and learning management systems.

### Platform-Specific Applications
Unlike native mobile applications or desktop software, MicroSims are not tied to specific operating systems or device types. They maintain platform independence through adherence to web standards and responsive design principles.

### Server-Dependent Systems
MicroSims do not require [server](../glossary.md#server)-side processing, [databases](../glossary.md#database), or cloud infrastructure for their core functionality. While they may optionally integrate with learning analytics platforms, their primary operation remains entirely client-side.

This definition establishes MicroSims as a distinct category of educational technology that bridges the gap between static educational content and complex simulation environments, providing an optimal balance of interactivity, accessibility, and pedagogical effectiveness.
