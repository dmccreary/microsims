# Introduction to the Formal Theory of MicroSims

## Definition of Educational MicroSims

We define an **Educational MicroSim** as a lightweight, standalone interactive simulation that executes within standard web browsers and is specifically designed for pedagogical applications. These simulations are characterized by the following key properties:

**Technical Architecture**: MicroSims are implemented as self-contained web applications, typically using JavaScript frameworks such as p5.js, that require no external dependencies or server-side infrastructure. They follow a standardized responsive design pattern with distinct regions for visualization (drawing area) and user controls (interaction area).

**Educational Purpose**: Each MicroSim targets specific learning objectives within a curriculum, enabling students to manipulate parameters and observe resulting changes in real-time. They support experiential learning by allowing learners to explore cause-and-effect relationships through direct interaction with underlying models or algorithms.

**Generative AI Integration**: MicroSims are designed to be automatically generated by large language models such as GPT-4 or Claude, following standardized templates and design patterns. This enables rapid creation of domain-specific simulations aligned with particular educational content and learning objectives.

**Accessibility and Extensibility**: The simulations are engineered for modification and extension by non-technical users including educators, students, and content creators. They employ consistent user interface conventions and well-documented code structures to facilitate customization without requiring advanced programming expertise.

**Learning Analytics Integration**: MicroSims generate structured event streams capturing user interactions, parameter adjustments, and exploration patterns. These data streams can be analyzed to assess learning progress and provide feedback to adaptive educational systems, including intelligent textbooks that employ reinforcement learning to optimize the learning experience.

**Scalability and Distribution**: Being browser-based and dependency-free, MicroSims can be easily distributed, embedded in various learning management systems, and accessed across different devices and platforms without installation requirements.

This definition establishes MicroSims as a distinct category of educational technology that bridges the gap between static educational content and complex simulation environments, providing an optimal balance of interactivity, accessibility, and pedagogical effectiveness.

## What MicroSims Are Not

To clarify the scope and boundaries of Educational MicroSims, it is important to establish what they explicitly are not:

**Technology-Agnostic Implementation**: MicroSims are not bound to any specific JavaScript library or framework. While our implementation examples utilize p5.js for its pedagogical clarity and ease of use, the MicroSim concept is library-agnostic and can be implemented using vanilla JavaScript, D3.js, Three.js, or any other web-based rendering technology that meets the functional requirements.

**Legacy Standards Compliance**: MicroSims do not adhere to traditional e-learning standards such as SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model), AICC (Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee), or xAPI (Experience API). These legacy standards impose architectural constraints and complexity that are incompatible with the lightweight, generative nature of MicroSims.  MicroSims can be designed to work with xAPI standards but these standards are not required.

**Metadata Standards Integration**: However, MicroSims do leverage established metadata standards where appropriate. They incorporate Dublin Core metadata elements for resource description, enabling proper cataloging, discovery, and interoperability within educational repositories and learning management systems.

**Comprehensive Simulation Environments**: MicroSims are not intended to replace complex, full-featured simulation platforms or virtual laboratories. They are purposefully constrained in scope to address specific, well-defined learning objectives rather than attempting to model entire systems or domains.

**Platform-Specific Applications**: Unlike native mobile applications or desktop software, MicroSims are not tied to specific operating systems or device types. They maintain platform independence through adherence to web standards and responsive design principles.

**Server-Dependent Systems**: MicroSims do not require server-side processing, databases, or cloud infrastructure for their core functionality. While they may optionally integrate with learning analytics platforms, their primary operation remains entirely client-side.

This definition establishes MicroSims as a distinct category of educational technology that bridges the gap between static educational content and complex simulation environments, providing an optimal balance of interactivity, accessibility, and pedagogical effectiveness.
