# Bloom's Taxonomy and Learning Objectives

## Summary

This chapter introduces Bloom's 2001 Taxonomy as a framework for designing educationally effective MicroSims. You will learn about the six cognitive levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create, and how each level suggests different types of interactive simulations. The chapter covers learning objectives, cognitive levels, the taxonomy pyramid, and objective classification techniques. Most importantly, you will learn MicroSim type selection strategies to match simulations with specific learning goals.
