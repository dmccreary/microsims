#### 1. What are the three components of a well-written learning objective?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Title, description, assessment
2. Action verb, content, conditions
3. Level, category, outcome
4. Subject, predicate, object
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Every learning objective contains an action verb (what the student will do), content (the subject matter), and conditions (context or constraints). For example: "Students will calculate (verb) the velocity of a projectile (content) given initial angle and speed (conditions)."

    **Concept Tested:** Learning Objectives

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

---

#### 2. What are the six levels of the revised Bloom's Taxonomy (2001) from lowest to highest?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation
2. Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create
3. Recall, Explain, Practice, Compare, Judge, Design
4. Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, Master, Creator
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The 2001 revised taxonomy uses verb forms: Remember (L1), Understand (L2), Apply (L3), Analyze (L4), Evaluate (L5), and Create (L6). The original 1956 taxonomy used nouns (Knowledge, Comprehension, etc.) and placed Synthesis above Evaluation.

    **Concept Tested:** Bloom's Taxonomy, Cognitive Levels

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

---

#### 3. What type of MicroSim is most appropriate for a Remember-level objective?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Physics simulator
2. Flashcard quiz or matching game
3. Model editor sandbox
4. Network graph explorer
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Remember-level objectives focus on recalling facts and basic concepts. Flashcard quizzes, matching games, and sorters are ideal because they practice active recall and recognition without requiring higher-order thinking.

    **Concept Tested:** Remember Level, MicroSim Type Selection

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

---

#### 4. Which Bloom's level does the objective "Compare and contrast capitalism and socialism" target?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Understand
2. Apply
3. Analyze
4. Evaluate
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. "Compare" and "contrast" are key verbs for the Analyze level, which involves breaking down information into components and examining relationships. The student must identify similarities and differences between the systems.

    **Concept Tested:** Analyze Level, Objective Classification

    **Bloom's Level:** Apply

---

#### 5. What distinguishes the Create level from other cognitive levels?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It requires the most memorization
2. Students produce original work that didn't exist before
3. It involves making judgments based on criteria
4. It focuses on explaining concepts clearly
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Create level (L6) is the highest cognitive level and involves producing new or original work by combining elements, designing solutions, or constructing models that didn't exist before.

    **Concept Tested:** Create Level

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

---

#### 6. For the objective "Calculate acceleration given mass and force," which MicroSim type is most appropriate?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Flashcard quiz
2. Animated explanation
3. Simulator or calculator
4. Rubric evaluator
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. "Calculate" is an Apply-level verb. Simulators and calculators are ideal for Apply-level objectives because they let students use formulas and procedures to solve problems with immediate feedback on their calculations.

    **Concept Tested:** Apply Level, MicroSim Type Selection

    **Bloom's Level:** Apply

---

#### 7. What is the difference between Lower-Order Thinking Skills (LOTS) and Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. LOTS are for beginners; HOTS are for experts
2. LOTS involve recall and comprehension; HOTS involve complex reasoning
3. LOTS use visual learning; HOTS use textual learning
4. LOTS are easier to assess; HOTS are harder to assess
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. LOTS include Remember and Understand (foundation skills involving recall and comprehension). HOTS include Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create (complex reasoning that builds on LOTS as prerequisites).

    **Concept Tested:** Cognitive Levels, Taxonomy Pyramid

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

---

#### 8. Which MicroSim type would best support an Evaluate-level objective?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Matching game
2. Animated explanation
3. Decision matrix or rubric evaluator
4. Flashcard drill
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Evaluate-level objectives require making judgments based on criteria and standards. Decision matrices, rubric evaluators, and argument analyzers are ideal because they structure the evaluation process with clear criteria.

    **Concept Tested:** Evaluate Level, MicroSim Type Selection

    **Bloom's Level:** Apply

---

#### 9. An objective states "Design an experiment to test a hypothesis." Which Bloom's level does this target?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Apply
2. Analyze
3. Evaluate
4. Create
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. "Design" is a Create-level verb. The student must produce an original experiment plan, which requires synthesizing knowledge about experimental design into something new.

    **Concept Tested:** Create Level, Objective Classification

    **Bloom's Level:** Apply

---

#### 10. What should you do if an action verb could apply to multiple Bloom's levels?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Always assume the lowest level
2. Always assume the highest level
3. Consider the context and what students must actually do
4. Choose the level randomly
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Some verbs (like "identify" or "explain") can indicate different levels depending on context. Look at what the student must actually do to demonstrate achievement. "Identify the parts of a cell" (Remember) differs from "Identify the cause of failure" (Analyze).

    **Concept Tested:** Objective Classification

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

---

#### 11. For an Analyze-level objective, which MicroSim types are most effective?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Flashcards and matching games
2. Network graphs and data explorers
3. Step-by-step calculators
4. Simple animated explanations
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Analyze-level objectives require examining relationships and breaking down information into components. Network graphs, data explorers, comparison tools, and causal loop diagrams are ideal because they enable students to explore connections and patterns.

    **Concept Tested:** Analyze Level, MicroSim Type Selection

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

---

#### 12. What is "scaffolding" in the context of MicroSim design for higher-level objectives?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Adding decorative visual elements
2. Including support for prerequisite skills within the MicroSim
3. Making the MicroSim taller on screen
4. Creating multiple versions of the same simulation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Scaffolding means including support for prerequisite skills within higher-level MicroSims. For example, an Apply-level simulator might include Remember elements (display the formula) and Understand elements (animated explanations) to help students who need foundational support.

    **Concept Tested:** MicroSim Type Selection

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand
