# Maps, Networks, and Timeline Visualizations

## Summary

This chapter covers specialized visualization libraries for geographic, network, and temporal data. You will learn to create interactive maps using Leaflet.js with OpenMaps data, build network graphs and org charts with vis-network including force-directed layouts and node coloring. The chapter explores timeline visualizations with vis-timeline for events, durations, and sequences. You will also learn about specialized MicroSims for 3D visualization, circuit simulation, equation graphing, and advanced libraries like ReactFlow for complex interactive diagrams.
