# Development Workflow for Educational MicroSims

## Introduction

The development of Educational MicroSims follows a systematic workflow that leverages existing resources, generative AI, prompt engineering, pre-defined rules and structured metadata to allow non-programmers to create personalized learning experiences. This document outlines the complete development process from initial discovery through integration into intelligent learning systems.

## 1. Repository Discovery and Initial SearchThe development workflow begins with discovering existing repositories of educational simulations. As evidenced by the search results, several established repositories exist:

**PhET Interactive Simulations** from the University of Colorado Boulder provides free interactive math and science simulations based on extensive educational research, while the **GitHub dmccreary/microsims repository** contains micro simulations specifically created by generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. **Gizmos by ExploreLearning** offers over 550 virtual, interactive STEM simulations designed to meet educational standards for grades 3-12.

These repositories serve as starting points for educators looking to find existing resources or templates for creating new MicroSims.

## 2. Faceted Search for Subject and Grade Level Refinement

Modern educational repositories implement sophisticated search capabilities that allow educators to narrow down resources using multiple criteria simultaneously. A typical faceted search interface would include:

**Subject Area Filters:**
- Mathematics (Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, Statistics)
- Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science)
- Computer Science
- Engineering
- Economics and Finance

**Grade Level Filters:**
- Elementary (K-5)
- Middle School (6-8)
- High School (9-12)
- Undergraduate
- Graduate
- Adult Education

**Learning Objective Filters:**
- Bloom's Taxonomy levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- Curriculum standards alignment (CCSS, NGSS, ISTE)
- Duration (5-15 minutes, 15-30 minutes, 30+ minutes)

**Example Search Scenario:**
An 8th-grade science teacher searching for physics simulations would filter by:
- Subject Area: Physics
- Grade Level: Middle School (6-8)
- Topic: Motion and Forces
- Bloom's Level: Apply
- Duration: 15-30 minutes

This filtered search would return a curated list of relevant MicroSims, such as projectile motion simulations or force and acceleration demonstrations.

## 3. Template-Based MicroSim Generation

Once an educator identifies a similar MicroSim that closely matches their needs, they can use it as a template for generating a customized version using generative AI tools. The template serves as both inspiration and technical foundation for the new simulation.

**Template Selection Process:**
1. **Identify Core Functionality:** Determine what aspects of the existing MicroSim align with learning objectives
2. **Analyze Technical Components:** Review the control interfaces, visual elements, and interaction patterns
3. **Extract Educational Elements:** Identify the underlying mathematical models, concepts demonstrated, and assessment opportunities

**Template Benefits:**
- Provides proven interaction patterns
- Establishes responsive design frameworks
- Demonstrates effective control placement
- Includes accessibility considerations

## 4. Sample Customization Prompt for Generative AI

Here's a comprehensive prompt for customizing a MicroSim based on an existing template:

```
I want to create a MicroSim for teaching quadratic functions to high school algebra students (grades 9-10). Please use the "Projectile Motion MicroSim" as a template but modify it to focus on mathematical concepts rather than physics.

Requirements:
- Subject Area: Mathematics (Algebra)
- Topic: Quadratic Functions
- Grade Level: 9-10
- Duration: 20-30 minutes
- Bloom's Level: Apply and Analyze

Modifications needed:
1. Replace physics variables (velocity, gravity, time) with mathematical parameters (a, b, c coefficients)
2. Show the parabola y = ax² + bx + c instead of trajectory
3. Add sliders for coefficients a (-5 to 5), b (-10 to 10), c (-10 to 10)
4. Display vertex coordinates, axis of symmetry, and y-intercept
5. Include a table showing x/y value pairs
6. Add a "Reset to Standard Form" button
7. Show the discriminant and number of real roots
8. Use colors to highlight different parts: vertex (red), roots (blue), y-intercept (green)

Technical specifications:
- Use p5.js framework
- Canvas height: 450 (400px drawing, 50px controls)
- Responsive width design with proper control placement
- Accessibility: Include describe() function and proper contrast
- Include standard MicroSim architecture with separated drawing and control regions

Please generate the complete JavaScript code following the MicroSim standards provided in the documentation.
```

## 5. Iterative Development with Preview and Refinement

The development process involves multiple iterations of generation, preview, and refinement. Modern AI-assisted development tools provide real-time preview capabilities that allow educators to see immediate results and request modifications.

**Preview and Testing Cycle:**
1. **Initial Generation:** AI creates the first version based on the prompt
2. **Preview Testing:** Educator tests functionality in a sandbox environment
3. **Feedback Collection:** Identify areas needing modification or enhancement
4. **Refinement Prompt:** Request specific changes or additions

**Sample Refinement Prompt for Adding/Removing Controls:**

```
The quadratic function MicroSim is working well, but I need these modifications:

ADD NEW CONTROLS:
1. Add a checkbox labeled "Show Grid" that toggles coordinate grid lines
2. Add a dropdown menu for "Function Type" with options:
   - Standard Form (y = ax² + bx + c)
   - Vertex Form (y = a(x-h)² + k)
   - Factored Form (y = a(x-r₁)(x-r₂))
3. Add a "Zoom" slider (0.5x to 3x) to scale the viewing window

REMOVE EXISTING CONTROLS:
1. Remove the "Reset to Standard Form" button (replace with a "Clear All" button)
2. Remove the discriminant display (students will calculate this separately)

MODIFY EXISTING FEATURES:
1. Change the coefficient 'a' slider range from (-5,5) to (-3,3) with steps of 0.1
2. Move all sliders to be horizontally aligned
3. Add units labels next to the vertex coordinates

Please maintain the existing responsive design and ensure all controls fit properly in the control region.
```

## 6. Metadata Generation for Cataloging

Once the MicroSim is finalized, the next step involves generating comprehensive metadata that describes the simulation for repository cataloging. This metadata follows the established schema for Educational MicroSims.

**Sample Metadata Generation Prompt:**

```
Please generate a comprehensive JSON metadata file for the quadratic functions MicroSim following the Educational MicroSim Metadata Schema. Include:

Dublin Core elements:

## Conclusion

The development workflow for Educational MicroSims represents a sophisticated pipeline that transforms educational needs into personalized, interactive learning experiences. By leveraging existing repositories, faceted search capabilities, AI-assisted generation, iterative refinement, comprehensive metadata, and intelligent integration systems, educators can create and deploy highly targeted simulations that adapt to individual student needs.

This workflow addresses the scalability challenges in educational technology while maintaining pedagogical rigor and technical quality. As the system matures, the accumulated data from thousands of student interactions will continuously improve both the individual MicroSims and the broader intelligent learning ecosystem, creating a self-improving educational technology platform that becomes more effective over time.
