# Pedagogy, Assessment, and Accessibility

## Summary

This chapter covers pedagogical foundations and accessibility standards for creating effective and inclusive MicroSims. You will learn cognitive load theory including extraneous, intrinsic, and germane load, Universal Design for Learning principles, and scaffolding strategies. The chapter introduces the PRIMM methodology (Predict-Run-Investigate-Modify-Make) and formative assessment techniques including quiz mode. You will also learn accessibility standards including the describe() function for screen readers, WCAG guidelines, color contrast requirements, keyboard navigation, and designing for educational equity with low-bandwidth and older device support.
