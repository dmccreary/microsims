# Responsive Design Techniques

## Summary

This chapter teaches techniques for making MicroSims adapt to different screen sizes and container widths. You will learn to use windowResized() and updateCanvasSize() functions to handle browser resizing, work with container width for responsive calculations, and implement relative positioning instead of absolute coordinates. The chapter covers the push(), pop(), and translate() functions for element grouping and coordinate translation, enabling you to create MicroSims that work well on both narrow textbook pages and fullscreen displays.
