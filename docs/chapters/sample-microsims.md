# Sample MicroSims

In this section we demonstrate some sample MicroSims.  We selected
them to range from simple to more complex and we also used
different back-end Javascript libraries.

## Bouncing Ball

This is our "Hello World!" program for a MicroSims.  It shows a
blue ball that bounces around within a `drawingArea`.  A single
horizontal slider allows you to adjust the speed of the ball.
Note that the simulation adapts to changes in screen width.

## Pythagorean Theorem

Our first Educational MicroSim shows a visualization of the Pythagorean Theorem.
The initial display shows a simple right triangle where the user can adjust
the length of two sides of a right triangle.  By checking the
