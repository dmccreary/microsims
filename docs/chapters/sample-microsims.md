# Sample MicroSims

In this section we demonstrate some sample MicroSims.  We selected
them to range from simple to more complex and we also used
different back-end Javascript libraries.

## Pythagorean Theorem

Our first Educational MicroSim shows a visualization of the Pythagorean Theorem.
The initial display shows a simple right triangle where the user can adjust
the length of two sides of a right triangle.  By checking the
