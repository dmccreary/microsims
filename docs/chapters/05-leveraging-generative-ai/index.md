# Leveraging Generative AI

## Summary

This chapter explores how to effectively use generative AI tools to accelerate MicroSim development. You will learn about large language models including ChatGPT and Claude, and develop prompt engineering skills for generating simulation code. The chapter covers iterative refinement techniques, AI-assisted debugging, and important concepts like token limits and context windows. You will also learn about AI limitations and hallucinations to use these tools responsibly, plus advanced techniques using rules files and skills development.
