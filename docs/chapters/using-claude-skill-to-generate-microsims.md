## How Skills Work with Agents

Building an entire intelligent textbook is a complex process requiring careful planning, the creation of detailed workflows
with human feedback and the decomposition of workflows into small discrete tasks.  
Once we have a task clearly defined, we need to match it to a set of complex content generation rules.
We use the name `skill` as a packaging systems for the rules associated with a given task.

A description of this workflow is shown below:

<!-- TOOD: Turn this graphic image into an interactive infographics 
Infographic Workflow Description.
Use a width-responsive design.
## Boxes
For each box, use rounded corners.
There are colorful boxes in four columns.
The Infographc has a single orange "Plan" box in the first column.
The Infographc has a single gold "Workflow" box in the second column.
Ihe Infographic has four green "Task" boxes in the third column.
Ihe Infographic has four blue "Skill" boxes in the fourth column.
## Connections
Connections are black arrows with an arrowhead on the right end.
A single black arrow connects the "Plan" box in the first column to the "Workflow" box in the second column.
Four arrows connect the single Workflow to the four "Tasks" in the third column.
Each "Task" in the third column is connected to a "Skill" in the fourth column.

## Hover
As the user hovers over a box, a tooltip box displays the definition of the box to the upper right of the box.
## Clickthroughs
When a user clicks on a box the page moves to the section of this document with that label by added #label to the end of the current URL
-->
![How Skills Work](images/skill-workflow.png)

Claude uses an intelligent task-matching system for skills:

While working on tasks, Claude scans available skills to find relevant matches. 
When one matches, it loads only the minimal information and files neededâ€”keeping Claude fast while accessing specialized expertise.

## Workflow Diagram

### Plan
Generative AI have strong planning mode to generate an overall strategy for the MicroSim.  This plan
uses rules of good instructional design to create a great user experience for students.

### Workflows
Contain many tasks that are all connected in a specific order.  Between tasks there may
be decision points and iteration to verify correctness.

### Task
A unit of work that can be matched to a single Skill.

### Skill
A set of rules for completing a task.

This architecture ensures efficient resource usage while maintaining access to specialized knowledge.


## Sample MicroSim Created by Skill

Here's an example of what the MicroSim-p5 skill can create with a simple prompt.

<iframe src="../sims/projectile-motion-gravity/main.html" height="452px" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Here is the prompt that was used to create this skill.

!!! prompt
   Using the MicroSim-p5 skill, create a new MicroSim that demonstrates
   the effect of gravity on projectile motion.  
   Name the MicroSim "projectile-motion-gravity".
   A canon is located in the lower left that shoots a ball.
   The MicroSim has a "Fire" and a "Reset" button and a single range control slider to change the gravity.  
   Each time the user presses "Fire" a parabolic path is drawn with a dashed line.
   The lines are only erased when the "Reset" button is pressed.

!!! note
   Some of the controls were not placed correctly in the control area.  The x coordinate of several controls were
   edited manually.  The rest of the code was correctly generated.

## What the MicroSim Creates

When you use the MicroSim-p5 skill, Claude generates a complete package including:

- **427-line** width-responsive p5.js application
- **121-line** index.md file that includes a user guide and lesson plan
- **12-line** main.html driver file
- **427-line** metadata.json file for search optimization

All files follow consistent patterns and best practices for educational simulations.

Here's the complete list of the steps for using the MicroSim-p5 skill:

1. **Step 1: Download MicroSim-p5 Skill from the MicroSim GitHub** - This will place the `MicroSim-p5.zip` file to your local hard drive
2. **Step 2: Upload the MicroSim-p5 Skill to Claude** - the skill file to your Anthropic Settings Capabilities
3. **Step 3: Reference the Skill In Your Prompt** - "Using the MicroSim-p5 skill..." to your prompt:
   - Example: *"Using the MicroSim-p5 skill create a new MicroSim that will show the effect of gravity on projectile motion. Have a slider change the gravity."*
4. **Step 4: Download your new MicroSim zip file to your local hard drive** download the zip file that Claude creates
5. **Step 5: Test the new JavaScript File in the p5 Editor** open the zip file and copy the JavaScript using the p5.js editor
6. **Step 6: Intall the Package in your textbook** Place the files in the `sims` folder of your textbook
7. **Step 7: Create a Social Media Preview**

**Note:** `Claude Code`, the Terminal version of Claude, can also use these skills and automatically install the MicroSim in your book.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Download the MicroSim p5 Skill from the MicroSim GitHub site to Your Local System

To begin, you need to download the MicroSim-p5 skill file:

**Go to:**
[https://github.com/dmccreary/microsims/blob/main/skills/microsim-p5.zip](https://github.com/dmccreary/microsims/blob/main/skills/microsim-p5.zip)

Click the download icon to save the `microsim-p5.zip` file to your local system.

![](images/skill-zip-download.png)

### Step 2: Upload the MicroSim-p5 Skill to Claude

Navigate to the Claude Settings Capabilities Menu:

**CLICK HERE:** [http://claude.ai/settings/capabilities](http://claude.ai/settings/capabilities)

In the **Skills** area, click the **"Upload skill"** button.

![Upload Skill](images/upload-skill-to-claude.png)

This page allows you to manage all your Claude capabilities, including Skills, Experimental features, and Connectors.

Once you're on the capabilities page with the Skills section open:

1. Locate the upload area for skills
2. **Drag and drop** the `microsim-p5.zip` file you downloaded

The skill will be uploaded and processed automatically.  You will then see a confirmation such as the following:

![Confirmation](images/skill-upload-confirmation.png)

After successful upload, you'll see a confirmation message indicating that the MicroSim-p5 skill has been added to your account.

![Success Confirmation](images/slide-11-img-1.png)

The skill is now ready to use in your Claude conversations!

### Step 3: Reference the MicroSim-p5 Skill in Your Prompt

Now you can start using the skill. Here's a sample prompt we described above:

!!! prompt
   Using the MicroSim-p5 skill, create a new MicroSim that demonstrates
   the effect of gravity on projectile motion.  
   Name the MicroSim "projectile-motion-gravity".
   A canon is located in the lower left that shoots a ball.
   The MicroSim has a "Fire" and a "Reset" button and a single range control slider to change the gravity.  
   Each time the user presses "Fire" a parabolic path is drawn with a dashed line.
   The lines are only erased when the "Reset" button is pressed.

!!! note
   Some of the controls were not placed correctly in the control area.  The x coordinate of several controls were
   edited manually.  The rest of the code was correctly generated.

**Note:** It's important to specify the name of your MicroSim so Claude knows what to call the folder and files.

Here is a sample response dialog from Claude:

![Claude MicroSim Creation Dialog](images/creation-dialog-01.png)

![Claude MicroSim Creation Dialog](images/creation-dialog-02.png)


Claude will respond with a detailed implementation, including:

- Complete p5.js code
- Explanation of the physics
- User guide
- Implementation notes


The output follows all the conventions and patterns defined in the MicroSim-p5 skill.


### Step 4: Testing the New MicroSim with the p5.js Editor

![p5.js Editor Testing](images/p5-editor-screen-image.png)

Before integrating into your textbook, test the MicroSim using the p5.js online editor:

**Example:** [https://editor.p5js.org/dmccreary/sketches/-aDDLBBD8](https://editor.p5js.org/dmccreary/sketches/-aDDLBBD8)

![p5.js Editor Testing Screen Image](images/p5-editor-screen-image.png)

The p5.j editor allows you to:
- Test interactivity
- Verify responsive behavior
- Make adjustments in layout before deployment
- Share directly from the editor

## Note on Control Placement

**Important Caveat:**

LLMs are not always perfect at the exact placement of UI controls. In this example, Claude made mistakes placing the button and slider controls in the controls area of the MicroSim.

You may need to manually adjust:
- X-position of sliders in the control region
- Button placement
- Label alignment

**Future Improvement:** Specific rules will be added to the skill to prevent these errors in the next version.

### Step 5 Share Your MicroSim Directly from p5.js

Within the p5.js editor there is a `File` menu in the upper left corner.  After you click on the `File` menu
it will then present a drop-down menu with the `Share` option.  By Clicking that it will open a
window that allows you to share the new MicroSim after a `Save` has been done.

![Share from p5.js](images/p5-editor-share.png)

The p5.js editor makes it easy to share your work in three ways:


#### Embed Iframe

In this mode, you just add a single `iframe` to your website.  This is ideal for authors
that want to embed a MicroSim in a region of their web page.

```html
<iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/dmccreary/full/-aDDLBBD8"></iframe>
```

#### Share URL for Full Screen for Execution but No Editing (Read Only)

```
https://editor.p5js.org/dmccreary/full/-aDDLBBD8
```

This mode is ideal if you want to provide a link to the MicroSim such as in
a webpage, email or chat.  In this mode, you can run the MicroSim but
you can't see or edit the source code.

#### Share with Full Editing:
```
https://editor.p5js.org/dmccreary/sketches/-aDDLBBD8
```



This generates a shareable link to your MicroSim that others can view and remix.

## Integrating Into a Textbook

![Textbook Integration](images/slide-17.png)

The following steps are for integrating your MicroSim into an intelligent textbook:

Intelligent textbooks put MicroSims "inline" into chapters of online books. They use a specific folder and file structure that facilitates sharing.

The MicroSim skill generates three additional files for textbook integration:

- Sample `main.html` file
- Sample `index.md` containing user guide and lesson plans
- Sample `metadata.json` to facilitate search in MicroSim search engines

The main JavaScript file (bouncing-ball.js) can then be modified and versioned as needed.

## Integrating into Web Pages is Easy!

Adding any MicroSim to a web page requires just one line of HTML:

```html
<iframe
   src="https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/sims/projectile-motion-gravity/main.html"
   height="452px"
   scrolling="no">
</iframe>
```

This `iframe` element allows you to securely add the file to your webpage.

**Benefits:**
- Can be added without jeopardizing the security of your site
- The simulation runs in a secure "sandbox"
- You do not need to make other changes to your website
- You can use CSS to style the border of the iframe

## Generate the MicroSim Package Zip File

![Generate Package](images/slide-19.png)

To get all the supporting files (not just the JavaScript), request a complete package:

!!! prompt
   Please generate a complete MicroSim package with all supporting files.

![Package Generation Dialog](images/slide-19-img-1.png)

This forces the skill to generate not just the JavaScript, but all the supporting files in a MicroSim package.

## Sample Dialog for Package Generation

![Sample Dialog](images/slide-20.png)

Claude will generate the complete package and provide a download link.

![Download Dialog](images/slide-20-img-1.png)

**CLICK HERE** to download the complete package as a zip file.

### Download the MicroSim Package that Claude Created

Click the download link to save the MicroSim package to your computer.

![Download Button](images/slide-21-img-1.png)

The package will download as `projectile-motion.zip` (or whatever name you specified).

### Unzip the MicroSim Package

![Unzip Package](images/slide-22.png)

Move and/or rename the extracted files to your textbook directory:

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ mv projectile-motion $BOOK/docs/sims/projectile-motion-gravity
```

![Terminal Commands](images/slide-22-img-1.png)

**Note:** Remove the zip file when you're done. The zip file should not be checked into your textbook site.

### Add to Navigation in mkdocs.yml

![Add to Navigation](images/slide-23.png)

Update your MkDocs configuration to include the new MicroSim in the navigation:

```yaml
- Projectile Motion With Gravity: sims/projectile-motion-gravity/index.md
```

![mkdocs.yml Edit](images/slide-23-img-1.png)

Add this line in the `nav:` section, indented with the other sims.


## Optional: Social Media Preview

![Social Media Preview](images/slide-24.png)

You can add a social media preview image that will appear when you share the MicroSim link:

This image will show when you:
- Copy the link into a chat
- Share on Messenger, Slack, Discord, or Zoom
- Reference the MicroSim on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn

![Preview Image Setup](images/slide-24-img-1.png)

**To enable this feature:**
1. Take a screen image of the MicroSim
2. Place it in the MicroSim folder with the same name as the folder:
   - Example: `projectile-motion-gravity.png`

**Note:** A future version of the skill might render the MicroSim and capture a screen image automatically. However, for now this is a manual step.

## Sample Metadata in HTML Head

The social media preview requires Open Graph (og) metadata in the HTML head element.  All Open Graph elements have the "og:" prefix in their property.

```html
<meta property="og:image"
      content="https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/sims/projectile-motion-gravity/projectile-motion-gravity.png">
```

This tag tells social media platforms which image to display when sharing your link.

## Sample Metadata in the index.md

![Markdown Metadata](images/slide-26.png)

The `index.md` file also includes metadata for the preview image:

![Metadata Example](images/slide-26-img-1.png)

**Note:** The path names are all relative to the `/docs` directory. You do not need to put in the full path.

---

## Test the Social Media Preview

There are many free websites that will test if the right metadata tags are placed correctly in the HTML header.

**Example:** [https://socialsharepreview.com/](https://socialsharepreview.com/)

![Social Share Preview Site](images/slide-27-img-1.png)

**Paste the URL of your MicroSim here** to see how it will appear when shared on social media.

---

## Positive Result!

![Test Success](images/slide-28.png)

When properly configured, your preview will look great:

![Successful Preview](images/slide-28-img-1.png)

For further details, you can search for **Open Graph standards** for title, description, and images.

---

## OG Tags Advice

![OG Tags Recommendations](images/slide-29.png)

The social media preview validator will provide feedback:

![OG Tags Analysis](images/slide-29-img-1.png)

Common recommendations:
- Our title and description are fine
- The ideal ratio for social preview images is **1.91:1** (width to height)
- Recommended dimensions: **1200 x 628 pixels**
