# User Interface Controls and Events

## Summary

This chapter covers interactive controls that allow users to manipulate MicroSim parameters. You will learn to create sliders and buttons using createSlider() and createButton(), implement start/stop/pause/reset functionality, and handle mouse and keyboard events. The chapter explores event handlers, the isRunning state pattern for animation control, and techniques for speed control and parameter adjustment. These skills enable you to create truly interactive educational simulations.
