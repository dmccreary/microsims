# Micro Simulations for Education

Welcome to the MicroSims for Education website.

A MicroSim (or Micro-Simulation) is a simple animation or simulation program that is quickly generated using generative AI to help teachers explain concepts to students.  MicroSims are
designed to be generated from a brief description of a problem using generative
AI tools such as ChatGPT.

The term **MicroSim** was coined by [Val Lockhart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valockhart/) in the summer of 2023 while she was working with generative AI.  She found that both teachers and students could generate useful simulations using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) with little or no training.


## The MicroSim Registry

One of our goals on this site is to create a library of MicroSims that can be used to fine-tune a generative AI application.  We have found that new [GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) will create higher-quality simulations if they are trained with a high-quality training set.  This reflects the fact that although there are tens of thousands of sample p5.js animations, many of them are created by first-time programmers.

Although it is easy for a non-programmer to use generative AI to create a new MicroSim, it is more difficult to find high-quality MicroSims that have been peer-reviewed by senior software developers and user experience designers.  These MicroSims have some of the following qualities:

1. Clearly labeled controls with values.
2. Controls placed at the bottom of the simulation
3. Controls aligned for visual aesthetics
