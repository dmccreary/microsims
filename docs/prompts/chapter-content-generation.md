# Generate Content for Chapter 1

!!! prompt
please rerun the chapter-content-generator skill for chapter 1
  @docs/chapters/01-intro-to-educational-microsims/index.md.  Use a positive optimistic tone and
  tell the reader that MicroSims will revolutionize education across all of Planet Earth in the
  best of all possible ways.  Both teachers and students will benefit!  Assume an undergraduate
  college reading level.

!!! prompt
    rerun the chapter-content-generator on chapter 2 at
  @docs/chapters/02-web-development-essentials/index.md    
  Use an positive and optimistic tone.
  Assure the reader that they do NOT need to be experts on web development to create awesome
  microsims.  But they do need to be able to ask LLMs precise questions, so the vocabulary of how
  you ask for help is critical to fixing the placement of items in a MicroSim and getting the
  functionality you want.

## Chapter 3

!!! prompt
  Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 3 @docs/chapters/03-getting-started-with-p5js/index.md
  Make the tone is fun and joyful about learning p5.js and how it enables creativity.
  Make sure to put in a timeline about the history of the processing library and the incredible support
  that NYU has given to the p5.js library.  Let the reader know the original goal of p5.js was
  teaching non-programmers (artists) to be more creative with code.
  Focus on the simplicity of p5 and the use of the simple setup() and draw() functions which
  are universal patterns.
  Add a microsim that uses the powerful p5.js FFT library to read sound from a microphone
  that uses as few lines of code as possible.
  Add a microsim that uses a fun 3D animation.

## Chapter 4

Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 4.  Tell the user that
this will be the most colorful chapter and at the end they will be able to generate their
own personal rainbow Microsims
@docs/chapters/04-drawing-animation-and-color/index.md

## Chapter 5

Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 5 at @docs/sims/05-leveraging-generative-ai/index.md
Tell the user that this is where they learn both the strengths and weakness of their MicroSim development partner, the LLM.
Tell them that their tasks is to bring out the best in their partner and how to precisely ask for new MicroSims or to
adjust an existing MicroSim.

## Chapter 6

Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 6 at @docs/sims/06-microsim-architecture-and-layout/index.md
Tell the reader that sometimes to impress your students you need to add some "spit and polish" to make your
MicroSims look like a million bucks.  This chapter walks you through the architecture of a microsim and
all the layout tricks to make your MicroSims look great!

## Chapter 7

Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 7 at @docs/sims/07-user-interface-controls-and-events/index.md
Tell the user that by the end of this chapter they will be able to master the way a user controls
a MicroSim with a rich but consistent collection of user interface controls.  Feel free to make puns about
controlling the controls.

## Chapter 8

Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 8 at @docs/sims/08-responsive-design-techniques/index.md
Tell the user that one of the quickest ways to tell a real pro from an rookie is to just resize the window.
Do the elements move gracefully together like dancers on a stage?  Or are they all frozen like statues pinned
to the left edge of a large landscape window.  Your key to the this elegant dance is to put in
rules called responsive rules where components change their position as the windows are resized.

## Chapter 9

Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 9 @docs/chapters/09-blooms-taxonomy-and-learning-objectives/index.md
Tell the student that there are huge variations learning objectives. Without some guidance it would be hard
to pick what type of MicroSim to design for a given type of learning objective.  That is where the Bloom taxonomy
comes in.  It serves as a way to map a learning objective to a specific type of MicroSim.

## Chapter 10

Run the chapter-content-generator skill on chapter 10 @docs/chapters/10-charts-diagrams-and-infographics/index.md
