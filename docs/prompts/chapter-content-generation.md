  Use an positive and optimistic tone.
  Assure the reader that they do NOT need to be experts on web development to create awesome
  microsims.  But they do need to be able to ask LLMs precise questions, so the vocabulary of how

  Focus on the simplicity of p5 and the use of the simple setup() and draw() functions which
  are universal patterns.
  Add a microsim that uses the powerful p5.js FFT library to read sound from a microphone
  that uses as few lines of code as possible.
  Add a microsim that uses a fun 3D animation.
