# Sample Prompts for Generating MicroSims

This area of our site contains guidelines on using
generative AI tools to create microsims.  There are
several strategies we employ.

## Leveraging Projects

Both Anthropic Claude and OpenAI have the concept of projects
where you can load sample code.  We strongly suggest
you load sample working MicroSimulation sketch files and
indicate in your prompts that you want to use these as templates.

## Why Templates Work

Generative AI is very good at generating algorithms, but not very good at generating layout.  By using templates with specific positioning rules
in the comments you can get much better layout.

## Publish Layout Rules In Your Project
