    Use the microsim-p5 skill to create a new sim called 'microsim-layout' with these specifications: 

    MicroSim Architecture Diagram
    Type: diagram

    Purpose: Show the standard two-region MicroSim architecture with labeled dimensions (Bloom: Remember, Understand)

    Canvas size: 400x450 pixels total

    Components to show:
    - Full canvas outline with label "canvasHeight = 450"
    - Width dimension with label "canvasWidth = 400"
    - Drawing region (top):
    - Background: alice blue (#F0F8FF)
    - Height label: "drawHeight = 400"
    - Contains sample visualization (bouncing ball with trajectory)
    - Margin lines shown as dashed (25px from edges)
    - Label: "Drawing Region"
    - Control region (bottom):
    - Background: white (#FFFFFF)
    - Height label: "controlHeight = 50"
    - Contains sample slider and label
    - Dividing line between regions (silver)
    - Label: "Control Region"
    - Margin annotations:
    - Arrows showing 25px margins on left, right, top
    - Label: "margin = 25"

    Visual style:
    - Clean, technical diagram style
    - Dimension lines with arrows
    - Dashed lines for margins
    - Color-coded regions

    Annotations:
    - "Visualization goes here" in drawing region
    - "User controls here" in control region
    - Formula: "canvasHeight = drawHeight + controlHeight"

    Color scheme:
    - Drawing region: alice blue (#F0F8FF)
    - Control region: white (#FFFFFF)
    - Dimension lines: dark gray (#333)
    - Margin lines: dashed light gray

    Implementation: Static diagram or simple p5.js visualization
