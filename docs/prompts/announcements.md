## Response

---
  Excited to announce our paper "MicroSims: A Framework for AI-Generated, Scalable Educational Simulations" is 
  now live on ArXiv!

  Educational simulations can improve conceptual understanding by 30-40% compared to traditional instruction,
  yet their adoption has been limited by high development costs, technical complexity, and platform dependence.

  Our paper introduces MicroSims - a framework that sits at the intersection of three key innovations:

  1. AI-Assisted Generation - Standardized design patterns that enable educators to create custom simulations
  from natural language descriptions

  2. Universal Embedding - Iframe-based architecture that works seamlessly across any LMS, interactive
  textbook, or digital learning platform

  3. Transparent, Modifiable Code - No black boxes. Educators can customize simulations to match specific
  curriculum needs

  The framework includes comprehensive design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards based on
  Dublin Core, and development workflows validated through 100+ working examples.

  Our goal: democratize access to interactive learning experiences so any educator can create
  curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

  Grateful to collaborate with Valerie Lockhart and Troy A. Peterson on this work, and to the p5.js community
  and PhET Interactive Simulations project for the research foundation.
