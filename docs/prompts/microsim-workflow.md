# MicroSim Workflow

!!! prompt
    Please help me create a document describes the development of a **Development workflow** Microsims.

    1.  Begin with a general search for a repository of Microsims
    2.  Discuss the use of faced searches to narrow down to a subject and grade level
    3.  Show how once the user finds a similar MicroSim they can then use this as a template for generating a similar MicroSim using a generative AI tool
    4.  Provide a sample prompt for customizing a MicroSim
    5.  Show how some tools that allow the user to preview the MicroSim and then repeat the process until they get the desired output. Give a sample prompt that adds or removes input controls
    6.  Show how the user can generate a metadata JSON file that describes the MicroSim in a catalog
    7.  Discuss the next steps for testing, feedback and then integration into a LMS that would recommend this MicroSim on a learning path of an intelligent textbook that uses the xAPI for logging interaction events for each student
