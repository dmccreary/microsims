# Course Description on Creating MicroSims with Generative AI

**Title:** Creating Educational MicroSims with Generative AI
**Audience:** Teachers, Educators and Instructors
**Course Length:** 14-week course taught to undergraduate students

## Prerequisites

Some knowledge of programming is helpful.  Students should be
familiar with basic concepts such as variables, control flow, loops
and debugging techniques.  Although many MicroSims are written
with JavaScript, knowledge of Python or other similar programming language is adequate.

## Course Overview

This 14-week course teaches students how to us generative AI to create educational interactive
web based simulations for the purpose of helping students master concepts.  Although most
generative AI programs can easily create simple animations, these animations are
often not useful at teaching concepts.  This course takes a student step-by-step
through the process of designing and implementing MicroSims that help students
reach their educational goals.  

## Introduction

We begin with the basic bouncing-ball MicroSim
written in p5.js.  We use AI to generate the code and then do a walkthrough
of the major sections of the program, global variables, `setup()` and `draw()`
functions.  We then add controls to allow the student to start/stop and
pause the simulation and change the speed.

We then demonstrate how other simulations such as projectile motion can be simulated
by adding variables such as angle and power.  We then describe the standard layout of 
a MicroSim and describe the drawing region and the control region of a MicroSim.
Students are then encouraged to explore the generation of simulations on their
own using tools such as ChatGPT, Claude or other LLM tools.
