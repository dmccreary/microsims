## The Learning Pyramid Quote

**Students retain approximately 75% of what they learn when they practice by doing, compared to just 5% of what they hear in lectures and 10% of what they read.**

That quote---sometimes called the "Learning Pyramid" or attributed to "Edgar Dale's Cone of Experience"---does not come from a verifiable, primary research study. In fact, it's considered apocryphal. While you'll see it widely repeated in teacher-training materials and on education websites, there is **no** recognized peer-reviewed source confirming that people retain "5% of what they hear in lectures, 10% of what they read, and 75% of what they practice by doing."

### Where It Is Often (Incorrectly) Cited

1.  **Edgar Dale's Cone of Experience (1946)**: Dale created a general visual model of how learners might engage with different types of media (e.g., verbal symbols, pictures, direct experiences), but he **never** attached fixed percentages of retention to these categories.
2.  **National Training Laboratories (NTL) "Learning Pyramid"**: This version is often claimed to come from internal NTL research, but the organization itself has never produced an original data source or methodology supporting these exact numbers.

### Scholarly Rebuttals

A few academic articles analyze the origins of these percentages and conclude that they are not based on any actual research. For example:

-   **Letrud, K. A. (2012). "A Rebuttal of NTL's Learning Pyramid or the 'Cone of Learning.'" *Education*, 133(1), 117--124.**
-   This paper explains that the purported retention rates can't be traced to a credible empirical study and appear to be a misunderstanding or misapplication of Dale's work.

### Key Takeaway

If you need a **verified** source for how students learn best or how retention rates differ by instructional method, it's best to refer to **peer-reviewed cognitive science or educational psychology research** (e.g., studies on retrieval practice, spaced repetition, active learning). The specific "5%, 10%, 75%" figures have no solid evidence behind them.

**In short, there is no legitimate citation for the exact 5%-10%-75% quote** because it has never been validated in a research study. It is often attributed to Dale or NTL, but neither can provide original data or a publication to support it. If you see those numbers repeated, know that they are anecdotal claims rather than empirically proven statistics.
