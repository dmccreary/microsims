# MicroSim Maximal Impact Analysis

Here is a use of the OpenAI ChatGPT Deep Research tool to help us focus on finding what MicroSims would have the maximal impact on education.

## Research Prompt

### Initial Deep Research Prompt
!!! prompt
    We represent a group of software engineers who have developed a framework for generative AI and agentic IDEs to quickly and efficiently generate classroom interactive simulations.  These interactive simulations, which we call MicroSims, run within a web browser and use the p5.js JavaScript library, which is ideal for running simulations and animations.  All our simulations have controls like sliders and buttons that require students to interact with the MicroSims.

    Our goal is to start creating new MicroSims that will have the most impact in schools from 5th grade through college.  Please research what interactive simulations would be most beneficial for teachers.  Focus on finding specific types of interactive simulations that would have the maximum positive impact on our students.  Do not focus on any country or geography.  Include a wide range of subjects, including math, geometry, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, robotics, systems thinking, graph databases, graph data modeling, graph algorithms, data science, machine learning, deep learning, agentic AI, user experience design, explainable AI and user interface design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    After you have found strong evidence of what MicroSims have a high positive impact, analyze the common characteristics of these MicroSims.  Include factors such as how many students might use these MicroSims and how effectively they explain complex concepts.  Conclude with a list of the categories of MicroSims that will have the most significant impact on education.

### Deep Research Clarification Response

I’d be happy to research this for you! To make sure the findings are as useful as possible, could you clarify the following:

1. Are you looking for research based on existing interactive simulations currently in use, or are you also interested in potential gaps where new simulations could have the most impact?
2. Do you want the analysis to focus more on student engagement, conceptual understanding, or both?
3. Would you like data on how teachers perceive the effectiveness of these simulations, or just how students interact with them?
4. Should the research focus more on STEM subjects, or should it also include humanities and other disciplines?
5. Would you like a breakdown of findings by education level (e.g., elementary, middle school, high school, college), or should it be generalized across all levels?
These details will help refine the research so it aligns closely with your objectives!

### My Response to Clarification

1. look at research on both existing MicroSims and opportunities to fill gaps
2. Include both student engagement and conceptual understanding
3. Focus on how students interact with the MicroSims
4. Focus on STEM subjects.  Do not include humanities.  Include systems thinking.
5. Return results generalized across all levels.

### Deep Research Response to Clarification Response

Great! I will research the most impactful interactive simulations for education, focusing on existing MicroSims and identifying opportunities to fill gaps. This will include STEM subjects and systems thinking, analyzing both student engagement and conceptual understanding. I will also examine how students interact with these simulations and generalize the findings across all education levels. I'll get back to you with detailed insights soon!

self-report survey from 1,233 high school and 276 college educators who are using PhET in their physics instruction, to provide insight into who uses PhET simulations, with which populations of students, towards what pedagogical goals, and with what instructional approaches. We found that new and experienced teachers use simulations, with diverse student populations, and to support a wide range of pedagogical goals. The responding high school and college educators were found to be similar in the goals they intended use of PhET simulations to support (for example, to develop conceptual goals, and to conduct science inquiry), but differed in their instructional approaches.

### Digital Simulations in STEM Education
Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review

Employing pre- and post-tests to evaluate intervention effectiveness. While inquiry-based learning emerges as the most frequently implemented instructional strategy, hybrid and simulation-based approaches also feature prominently. Despite the evident benefits of digital simulations in enhancing conceptual understanding, engagement, and problem-solving skills, research gaps remain, particularly regarding their application in primary and special education contexts. This review underscores the need for diverse research methodologies and broader population studies to maximize the potential of digital simulations in STEM education.

### Digital Simulations in STEM Education
Insights from Recent Empirical Studies, a Systematic Review

The review includes 31 peer-reviewed empirical studies published in the last five years, sourced from ERIC, Scopus, and Web of Science, and adheres to the PRISMA methodology to ensure transparency and rigor. The findings reveal that interactive simulations are the most widely used type of digital tool, accounting for 25 of the 31 studies, followed by game-based simulations and virtual labs. Quasi-experimental designs dominate the research landscape, often employing pre- and post-tests to evaluate intervention effectiveness. While inquiry-based learning emerges as the most frequently implemented instructional strategy, hybrid and simulation-based approaches also feature prominently.

Before the implementation of the learning environment (over a period of five 90-min lessons) two written tests were administered to the students, investigating the development of seven aspects of system thinking. The same tests were administered after the implementation. Specifically, four of the tasks included in each test were associated with skills concerning the structure and the elements of a system and three were associated with the processes and interactions taking place within a system.
