      "question": "How do I use Claude Code for MicroSim development?",
      "answer": "Claude Code is a CLI tool that integrates Claude directly into your development workflow. Instead of copying code back and forth, Claude Code can read and write files directly. Say 'Read sketch.js and add a reset button' and it will understand your existing code and make integrated changes.",

      "answer": "Rules files provide consistent context to AI about your project's standards. Create a markdown file with sections for canvas standards, variable naming, code structure, control placement, and required elements. Reference this file at the start of AI conversations or include it in your project.",

      "answer": "Wrap related drawing commands between push() and pop(). After push(), use translate(x, y) to set the group's origin. Draw elements relative to (0,0). The pop() restores the original coordinate system. This lets you move entire groups by changing just the translate values.",
