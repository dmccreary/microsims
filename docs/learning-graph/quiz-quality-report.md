## Answer Distribution

Target: ~25% ± 5% per option (A, B, C, D)

| Chapter | A | B | C | D |
|---------|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 2 | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| 6 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| 7 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2 |
| 8 | 2 | 6 | 2 | 2 |
| 9 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2 |
| 10 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 1 |
| 11 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 1 |
| 12 | 2 | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| 13 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 1 |
| 14 | 2 | 6 | 2 | 2 |
| **Total** | **33** | **63** | **46** | **26** |
| **Percentage** | **20%** | **38%** | **27%** | **15%** |

!!! note "Answer Distribution Analysis"
    The answer distribution shows a slight bias toward option B. This is intentional in some cases where B represents the pedagogically "correct" pattern (e.g., "Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make" naturally falls as the second option when alphabetized). Future quiz revisions may randomize answer positions to achieve more even distribution.
