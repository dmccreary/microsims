# Structure of a MicroSim Demonstration

To make it easier for developers to understand and reuse our MicroSims, we are proposing the following directory and file standards.

## Required Components

1. Directory with the name of the app
2. index.md file within this directory.  The index.md file has a link the HTML file.
3. HTML file that displays the application.  It also loads the JavaScript file and provides a link back to the main index.md file.
4. JavaScript file that holds the simulation code.  

## Optional Components

1. An image of the working simulation.
2. A sample set of one or more prompts that were used to generate the simulation.
3. Sample of code that was generated
4. Related simulations
