# Introduction to MicroSims

## Background on Processing

## Avoid the Urge to Fix the Code

Always go back to the ChatGPT and tell it what is not working and suggest a fix.

## Start with a Simple Prompt

Start with a simple prompt that describes the core function that you would like done.

## Add Controls

Start adding controls such as sliders and buttons.  A good simulation always allows the user to change parameters such as the animation speed and how to start, stop, step and reset the simulation.

## Focus on Usability

## Share Your MicroSim

The best way to share your simulation is to create a pull request with your working simulation.  Make sure you read the [MicroSim structure](./04-structure.md) document
to get an idea of how to best structure your code.

If you are not clear on how to do a pull request, you can always open an [issue](https://github.com/dmccreary/microsims/issues) in
GitHub and post your code there.
