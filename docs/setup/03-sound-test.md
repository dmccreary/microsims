# Sound Test

Make sure you add the following line to your .html file:

```html
    <script src="../js/p5.sound.min.js"></script>
```

The line can be place right after the loading of the p5.js library in the html head section.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>String Harmonics</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.0/p5.js"></script>
    <script src="../js/p5.sound.min.js"></script>
```

We suggest having the default mode of a sim have the sound off.  Add
a button to turn the sound on.
