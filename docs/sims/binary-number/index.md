# Binary Number

A binary number is one where each of the digits can only be a 0 or a 1.  The values
will double with each position.  So the left-most digit is 0 or 1, and the second is 0 or 2, the third is 0 or 4 and the fourth is 0 or 8.  You can generate any number from 0 to 15 by adding the values.
