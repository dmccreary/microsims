## About This Visualization

This causal loop diagram illustrates the interconnected processes that make a global MicroSim library ecosystem work effectively. Click through each step to understand how educators, AI systems, and quality metrics work together to continuously improve educational simulations.

## Learning Objectives

After exploring this visualization, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand** the role of centralized searchable libraries in educational content distribution
2. **Identify** the key stakeholders involved in creating and improving MicroSims
3. **Explain** how feedback loops drive continuous improvement in educational resources
4. **Recognize** the importance of metadata and quality metrics in content discovery

## The Five Stages of the Ecosystem

### Step 1: Central MicroSim Search Hub

The foundation of the ecosystem is a centralized, searchable library of MicroSims. Key components include:

- **Faceted Search**: Allows educators to filter by subject, grade level, learning objective, and quality ratings
- **Library Administration**: Curates and maintains the collection
- **AI Quality Robot**: Automatically validates metadata and checks for accessibility compliance

### Step 2: New MicroSim Creation

Educators worldwide contribute to the library through a standardized process:

1. Teacher identifies a learning need not met by existing resources
2. Design the simulation with AI assistance
3. Test and refine with real students
4. Package with proper metadata.json
5. Upload to the central library

### Step 3: Teacher Search

When educators need a simulation, they follow this workflow:

1. Define the learning objective they want to address
2. Search the library using faceted filters
3. Preview multiple options
4. Sort by popularity and effectiveness ratings
5. Embed the chosen MicroSim in their course materials

### Step 4: Field Usage Statistics

Real-world usage generates valuable data:

- **Student Engagement Metrics**: Time on task, interaction patterns
- **Teacher Feedback**: Ratings, comments, and suggestions
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Aggregates data across all deployments
- **Effectiveness Metrics**: Correlation with learning outcomes

### Step 5: Upload Improvements

The cycle completes when improvements are shared:

- Field statistics identify enhancement opportunities
- AI suggests specific improvements based on usage patterns
- Teachers refine simulations based on evidence
- Impact scores track the effectiveness of changes
- Improved versions are shared back to the community

## The Virtuous Cycle

The power of this ecosystem lies in its self-reinforcing nature:

- Better simulations attract more users
- More usage generates better data
- Better data enables smarter improvements
- Improvements make simulations more effective
- Higher effectiveness attracts even more users

## Technical Implementation

This visualization is built using:

- **vis-network**: JavaScript library for network graph visualization
- **Progressive Reveal**: Step-by-step exploration of complex systems
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Animated Counters**: Dynamic statistics that grow with each step

## Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Play/Pause** | Automatically cycle through all steps (3-second intervals) |
| **Previous** | Go back one step |
| **Next** | Advance to the next step |
| **Reset** | Return to Step 1 |
| **Hover** | Highlight connected nodes in the network |

## Discussion Questions

1. What barriers might prevent educators from contributing to a shared MicroSim library?
2. How could AI improve the quality and discoverability of educational simulations?
3. What metrics would best indicate the effectiveness of a MicroSim?
4. How might this ecosystem model apply to other educational resources beyond simulations?
