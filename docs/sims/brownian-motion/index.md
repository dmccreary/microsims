The bouncing ball is the "Hello World!" of the Processing system.
It contains the key element that shows the power of the Processing system:
graphics with movement and user interaction.  When we design MicroSims, we also
want clearly-visible user interface elements that can control
the running of our simulations.  This version contains a 
slider to control the speed of the ball's movement.
