# Galton Board

Create a p5.js sketch that simulates a Galton Board.The sketch has "New Ball" button that triggers a ball with radius=5 falling from the top middle of a canvas.  Below it is a set of pins in a triangular pattern.  The ball will bounce on the top pin. There is a 50% chance the ball bounces left and 50% on the right. There is a second row of two pins, each with the same odds. On the third row, there are four pins. Continue this pattern for 6 rows.  Add a button for "new ball".
This is all called a Plinko game.
