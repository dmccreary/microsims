Generate a simulation of breadth-first-search on a graph.  
Place a green vertex at the center of a network of 20 
vertices that are placed on the canvas.  
Connect each vertex to the 2 or 3 closest vertices 
using edges. For each step in the search, 
color the next vertex red.  
Repeat until all vertices have been visited.
