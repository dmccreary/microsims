# AI-Assisted MicroSim Creation Workflow

This workflow diagram illustrates the complete process teachers follow when creating educational MicroSims with AI assistance. The process transforms learning objectives into interactive simulations in minutes rather than months.

## Color Legend

- **Green**: Start and end points
- **Blue**: Teacher actions
- **Purple**: AI-assisted steps
- **Orange**: Testing and feedback
- **Yellow**: Decision points

## Workflow Steps

1. **Identify Learning Objective** - Define the specific concept students should understand
2. **Describe the Visualization** - Determine what students should see and manipulate
3. **Write AI Prompt** - Describe the MicroSim layout, controls, behavior, and appearance
4. **Generate Initial Code** - AI produces working p5.js code based on your description
5. **Test in p5.js Editor** - Run the code to verify it works as expected
6. **Meets Learning Objective?** - Evaluate if the MicroSim effectively teaches the concept
7. **Refine with AI** - If needed, describe changes and iterate
8. **Add to Course Materials** - Embed in textbook, LMS, or website
9. **Gather Student Feedback** - Observe usage and note improvements
10. **Effective Learning Tool** - Students learn through interaction

## Key Concepts

- **Rapid Iteration**: The AI-assisted workflow enables quick prototyping and refinement
- **Teacher-Centered Design**: Teachers maintain control over learning objectives and pedagogical approach
- **Continuous Improvement**: Student feedback drives ongoing enhancements
- **Minutes, Not Months**: AI acceleration dramatically reduces development time
