# AI-Assisted MicroSim Creation Workflow

This workflow diagram illustrates the complete process teachers follow when creating educational MicroSims with AI assistance. The process transforms learning objectives into interactive simulations in minutes rather than months.

## Color Legend

- **Green**: Start and end points
- **Blue**: Teacher actions
- **Purple**: AI-assisted steps
- **Orange**: Testing and feedback
- **Yellow**: Decision points

## Workflow Steps

1. **Identify Learning Objective** - Define the specific concept students should understand
2. **Describe the Visualization** - Determine what students should see and manipulate
3. **Write AI Prompt** - Describe the MicroSim layout, controls, behavior, and appearance
4. **Generate Initial Code** - AI produces working p5.js code based on your description
5. **Test in p5.js Editor** - Run the code to verify it works as expected
6. **Meets Learning Objective?** - Evaluate if the MicroSim effectively teaches the concept
7. **Refine with AI** - If needed, describe changes and iterate
8. **Add to Course Materials** - Embed in textbook, LMS, or website
9. **Gather Student Feedback** - Observe usage and note improvements
10. **Effective Learning Tool** - Students learn through interaction

## Key Concepts

- **Rapid Iteration**: The AI-assisted workflow enables quick prototyping and refinement
- **Teacher-Centered Design**: Teachers maintain control over learning objectives and pedagogical approach
- **Continuous Improvement**: Student feedback drives ongoing enhancements
- **Minutes, Not Months**: AI acceleration dramatically reduces development time

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain the complete workflow for creating AI-assisted educational simulations
- Identify the role of learning objectives in driving MicroSim design
- Describe how iterative refinement improves educational content
- Evaluate when a MicroSim effectively meets its learning objectives

### Target Audience

- Educators and instructional designers
- K-12 and higher education teachers
- Curriculum developers
- Educational technology specialists

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of educational content creation
- Familiarity with learning objectives and Bloom's Taxonomy
- No coding experience required

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Hover over each node in the workflow diagram to understand the purpose of each step. Note the color coding that distinguishes teacher actions from AI-assisted steps.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Starting from a simple learning objective (e.g., "Students will understand the relationship between radius and area of a circle"), walk through each step of the workflow and describe what you would do at each stage.

3. **Extension Activity**: Create your own AI prompt for a MicroSim based on a learning objective from your curriculum. Follow the workflow to refine your prompt before generating code.

### Assessment

- Can you explain why the workflow starts with identifying a learning objective rather than describing a visualization?
- What is the purpose of the refinement loop in the workflow?
- How does gathering student feedback contribute to creating an effective learning tool?
