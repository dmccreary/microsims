## About This MicroSim

The Color Wheel Harmonies MicroSim helps students understand color relationships through interactive exploration. By clicking and dragging around the color wheel, students can select any hue and see how different harmony modes create color palettes that work well together.

## How to Use

### Selecting Colors

- **Click** anywhere on the color wheel to select a base color
- **Drag** around the wheel to smoothly change your selection
- The selector dot shows your current color choice

### Harmony Modes

Use the dropdown menu to switch between harmony types:

1. **Complementary** - Shows the color directly opposite (180°) on the wheel
   - Creates maximum contrast and visual tension
   - Great for making elements stand out

2. **Analogous** - Shows two colors adjacent to your selection (±30°)
   - Creates smooth, harmonious combinations
   - Found naturally in many settings (sunset colors, foliage)

3. **Triadic** - Shows colors 120° apart
   - Creates vibrant, balanced compositions
   - Popular in design for dynamic yet balanced palettes

4. **Split-Complementary** - Shows two colors adjacent to the complement
   - High contrast but less tension than complementary
   - Good for beginners as it's hard to mess up

### Information Panel

The right panel displays:
- Selected color swatch (large)
- HSB and RGB color values
- Color name
- Harmony color swatches
- Description of the current harmony mode

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, learners will be able to:

1. **Identify** the 12 colors on a traditional color wheel
2. **Understand** how color relationships are determined by angular distance
3. **Analyze** why certain color combinations feel harmonious or tense
4. **Apply** color harmony principles to design choices
5. **Compare** the visual effects of different harmony modes

## Color Theory Background

### The Color Wheel

The color wheel arranges colors in a circle based on their relationships:

- **Primary Colors**: Red, Yellow, Blue (cannot be mixed from others)
- **Secondary Colors**: Orange, Green, Violet (mixed from two primaries)
- **Tertiary Colors**: The six colors between primaries and secondaries

### Why Harmonies Work

Color harmonies are based on geometric relationships on the wheel:

| Harmony | Angle | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Complementary | 180° | Maximum contrast |
| Analogous | 30° | Natural flow |
| Triadic | 120° | Dynamic balance |
| Split-Complementary | 150°/210° | Softer contrast |

## Suggested Activities

### Activity 1: Explore Each Harmony
Select a base color and cycle through all four harmony modes. Describe how the "feel" of the palette changes.

### Activity 2: Find Natural Harmonies
Think of natural scenes (sunset, forest, ocean) and use the wheel to identify which harmony mode they represent.

### Activity 3: Design Application
Choose a harmony mode and create a simple design (logo, poster concept) using only those colors plus black and white.

### Activity 4: Complementary Pairs
Find all six complementary pairs on the wheel. Which pair creates the most visual tension?

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
Middle School (6-8) through High School Art/Design classes

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of primary and secondary colors
- Familiarity with the concept of hue

### Duration
15-20 minutes for guided exploration

### Procedure

1. **Introduction (3 min)**: Explain that colors have mathematical relationships based on position on the wheel.

2. **Demonstration (5 min)**: Show each harmony mode using red as the base color. Discuss the visual effect of each.

3. **Guided Exploration (5 min)**: Students explore different base colors while you ask guiding questions.

4. **Creative Application (5 min)**: Students choose a harmony for a hypothetical design project and explain their choice.

### Discussion Questions

- Why do you think complementary colors are used in sports team logos?
- Which harmony mode would you choose for a relaxing spa website? Why?
- How do movie posters use color harmony to convey mood?
