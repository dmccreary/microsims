## Overview

The Global Impact visualization demonstrates the exponential growth and spread of MicroSims and intelligent textbooks across continents. Watch as knowledge flows from creators to central libraries and out to students in schools around the world.

## How to Use

### Animation Controls

- **Play/Pause Button**: Start or stop the automatic animation showing the growth of the network over time
- **Time Slider**: Manually scrub through time to see how the network evolves from Year 1 to Year 5
- **Statistics Panel**: Watch real-time counters for MicroSims created, knowledge connections, and countries reached

### Interactive Features

- **Hover over nodes**: See detailed information about each location
- **Click on markers**: View popup with specific MicroSim examples and statistics
- **Zoom and pan**: Explore different regions of the map in detail

## Visual Elements
