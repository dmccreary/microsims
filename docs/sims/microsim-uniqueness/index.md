## About this MicroSim

This interactive MicroSim visualizes the unique position of MicroSims in educational technology through a three-circle Venn diagram. The three circles represent:

- **Simplicity**: Focused simulations with clear parameters, transparent code, and constrained scope
- **Accessibility**: Universal embedding via iframes, works on any device, platform-independent
- **AI Generation**: Created in seconds by language models through standardized patterns

At the center, where all three circles overlap, sits "MicroSims" - representing how these three characteristics uniquely converge to create a new paradigm in educational content.

### How to Use

Hover your mouse over different regions of the Venn diagram to learn about:

- Individual characteristics (single circles)
- Pairwise combinations (two-circle overlaps)
- The unique convergence (center where all three meet)

Each region displays a tooltip explaining its significance based on the [What Makes MicroSims Unique](../../why/uniqueness.md) article.

## Educational Value

This MicroSim demonstrates:

1. **Visual representation of concepts**: Complex relationships shown through overlapping circles
2. **Interactive learning**: Hover interactions reveal detailed information
3. **Set theory**: Visual representation of intersections and unions
4. **Educational technology taxonomy**: Understanding how different characteristics combine

## Technical Implementation

The MicroSim follows the standard width-responsive design pattern:

- **Canvas dimensions**: 400px initial width (responsive), 480px total height (400px drawing + 80px controls)
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to container width using `windowResized()` and `updateCanvasSize()`
- **Interactive regions**: Mouse hover detection calculates distances to determine which region is active
- **Blend mode**: Uses p5.js `MULTIPLY` blend mode for authentic Venn diagram appearance
- **Dynamic tooltips**: Context-sensitive text wrapping in the control area

## Sample Prompt

!!! prompt
    Create a p5.js MicroSim that displays an interactive three-circle Venn diagram.
    The three circles should be labeled "Simplicity", "Accessibility", and "AI Generation"
    and arranged in an equilateral triangle pattern. Place "MicroSims" at the center where
    all three circles overlap. When users hover over any region (single circles,
    two-circle overlaps, or the center), display a tooltip explaining that region's
    significance. Use semi-transparent colors with blend mode for proper Venn diagram
    visualization. Make it width-responsive following the standard MicroSim patterns.

## Learning Objectives

Students and educators will:

- Understand the three key characteristics that make MicroSims unique
- Visualize how combining multiple attributes creates something new
- Explore set theory through interactive visualization
- Learn about the educational technology landscape

## Lesson Activities

### Activity 1: Identify the Regions

Have students hover over each region and identify:
- How many characteristics are present
- What makes each combination significant
- Why the center represents something unique

### Activity 2: Create Your Own Venn Diagram

Ask students to:
- Identify three characteristics of another concept (e.g., their school, a sport, a book)
- Sketch a three-circle Venn diagram
- Label what exists at each intersection
- Discuss what makes the center unique

### Activity 3: Extend the Concept

Challenge students to:
- Add a fourth circle to represent another dimension
- Modify the tooltip text to add their own insights
- Change the colors to improve visual clarity
- Add click interactions that link to more information

## Extensions

Possible enhancements:

1. **Click interactions**: Click regions to navigate to detailed documentation
2. **Animation**: Animate circles growing from center on load
3. **Statistics**: Show percentage breakdown of each characteristic
4. **Comparison mode**: Toggle to show different educational technology paradigms
5. **Export feature**: Save the diagram as an image
