# MicroSim Submission Guidelines

## The Easy Way For Newcomers

The quickest way to help us grow content is to just open an Issue on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dmccreary/microsims/issues) page. Put in a short description and all your code.  If you are using the p5.js editor you can just paste in a link to your code there.  We will take care of the rest.

## For Experienced GitHub Users

We prefer you submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) to our site. This allows us to test your code and then merge your changes directly into the "sims" directory.

## Usability Tips

1. Create a new directory for you MicroSim in the docs/sims area
2. Copy the [Sims Template](./sims/template/) to get started
3. Provide a background in your index.md file
4. Include an image of your working MicroSim in the index.md file
5. Include a link to your MicroSim html file in the index.md file
6. Include a link to the MicroSim running in the p5.js editor
7. Include the JavaScript file in your index.md file
8. Place the MicroSim controls below your drawing region
9. Provide a simple example with just one or two sliders and if appropriate, have a line to an "Advanced" version with multiple sliders
10. Use a very light gray or '''aliceblue''' color as the background of your drawing region.  Use white as the background for the controls region.

## Sample Templates for Drawing and Controls Region
